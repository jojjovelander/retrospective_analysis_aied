ABSTRACT: Simulation-based training would benefit from direct exploitation of observational data obtained during operations. The goal of current research is to develop algorithms and software that transfers data captured in operational settings to training simulation, enabling learners to experience in simulation training a scenario that mimics a real-life situation. In prior work, we explored the direct application of deep learning to this challenge. In this paper, we outline a refined approach that adopts a formally-defined knowledge representation that is used to encode observed changes in state ('events') that occur during operations. The event representation enables explicit comparisons of events and event sequences between observed and generated missions and it allows more tractable application of machine learning for capturing the properties of individual events (in comparison to an entire mission). © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The increasing ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence in consumer products, toys, and various smart technologies and applications creates the necessity for the current generation of children to forge a finer understanding of the technology. One way to achieve such a form of comprehension and resourcefulness is through meaningful engagement with AI in an educational context. Inclusion of AI literacy and AI thinking in the school curriculum are in their early adoption phases in various countries. This paper explores the efforts put forth in AI curriculum implementation in schools through teacher education programs in India. The early and post-Training perspectives of the teachers have been observed, and the challenges reported by teachers in influential factors such as lapses in policy communication, infrastructure, pedagogy, content delivery and the influence of culture in the context of Indian schools have been discussed. The results indicate a poor belief state in the potential of AI among teachers and the interest to explore peer teaching and game-based approaches in the classroom to introduce AI, among other findings. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Scientrometrics is a branch of science which performs reproducible measurements of scientific activity. Scientometric analysis of research papers/ articles indexed in Scopus database (www.scopus.com) for last ten years (2009 to 2018) have been done. The study focuses on the research publications for the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in higher education. A scientometric assessment of the trend of the research papers on AI usage in education sector have been presented in the study by way of analyzing; annual growth of research publications of AI (both globally and country wise) and growth trend of the 'AI usage in education' publications (both country-wise as well as individual share). The study reveals the growth of AI in research publications both in international and in Indian context, but its applicability in the field of higher education is substantially low. The usage of AI in Indian education sector has tremendous scope for growth and in most likelihood research publications in the said field will expand considerably in years to come. This study will help subject specialists, researchers, policy makers for drafting effective policies, and those who wish to map the scientrometric patterns of research publications in the capacity of academic administrator or as an individual. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study at hand was to examine students' perceptions of game elements used in gamification application. ClassDojo, as a study case, was implemented class-wide in a Moroccan High School EFL classroom. Data was gathered and saved directly through the application. It is qualitative research that opted for structured interviews to collect data. The findings were evaluated in so far as class motivation, participation, cooperation, discipline, attendance, and classroom discourse are concerned. This study has shown a crystal clear improvement in terms of discipline, motivations and classroom participation, suggesting the great need to conduct more research with a view to determine if these areas could be positively or negatively impacted when integrating ClassDojo in classroom management on a large scale. The findings of this study are of much significance to decision makers, curriculum developers, syllabus designers, and teachers in both senior and junior schools in Morocco. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to impact almost every aspect of health care, from detection to prediction and prevention. The adoption of new technologies in health care, however, lags far behind the emergence of new technologies. Health care professionals and organizations must be prepared to change and evolve to adopt these new technologies. A basic understanding of emerging AI technologies will be essential for all health care professionals. These technologies include expert systems, robotic process automation, natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. Health care professionals and organizations must build their capacity and capabilities to understand and appropriately adopt these technologies. This understanding starts with basic AI literacy, including data governance principles, basic statistics, data visualization, and the impact on clinical processes. Health care professionals and organizations will need to overcome several challenges and tackle core structural issues, such as access to data and the readiness of algorithms for clinical practice. However, health care professionals have an opportunity to shape the way that AI will be used and the outcomes that will be achieved. There is an urgent and emerging need for education and training so that appropriate technologies can be rapidly adopted, resulting in a healthier world for our patients and our communities. © 2019

ABSTRACT: In personalized learning systems, personal information and learning information are usually analyzed for providing proper instruction for individuals. On the other hand, scholars have indicated the challenge of proposing models owing the lack of taking various data types into account. Several previous studies have indicated that without properly incorporating learning behavior into the personalized learning systems might fail to help students learn with proper learning process. To address this issue, this study proposes a model for analyzing ongoing learning data and adapting personalized learning experience. Besides, this study presents an overall structure of a personalized learning system that can work with the proposed mechanism. In comparison with other models, the proposed model performed the best with high accuracy; consequently, it can be deployed in the presented learning system. The findings of this study not only address the significance of ongoing learning experience in the personalized learning system but also enable a practical example to increase learning motivation in the online learning world, in particular STEM-related courses. © ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational chatbots have gained popularity over time, and have been widely used in the fields of e-commerce, online banking, and digital healthcare and well-being, among others. The technology has the potential to provide personalised service to a range of consumers. However, the use of chatbots within educational settings is still limited. In this paper, we present three chatbot prototypes, the Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick, are currently developing, and discuss the potential opportunities and technical challenges we face when considering AI chatbots to support our daily activities within the department. Three AI virtual agents are under development: 1) to support the delivery of a taught Master's course simulation game; 2) to support the training and use of a newly introduced educational application; 3) to improve the processing of helpdesk requests within a university department. We hope this paper is informative to those interested in using chatbots in the educational domain. We also aim to improve awareness among those within the chatbot development industry, in particular the chatbot engine providers, about the educational and operational needs within educational institutes, which may differ from those in other domains. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

DOI: 10.5958/0976-5506.2019.04280.3
ABSTRACT: Background/Objectives: The object of the research is to navigate how ethical value and ethical sensitivity of nursing students have changed over the course of 4 years of education. Methods/Statistical analysis: The first data was collected from 200 nursing students of two schools that were marked for convenience before the regular nursing ethics course began. The additional data were collected on the end of May of 2016, 2017 and 2018. Average and standard deviation of the collected data were calculated, and repeated ANOVA was used for finding change of difference by school year. Findings: The result of the research demonstrates that there is a significant difference of change of ethical value by school year (F=184.30, p<.000). There is also a significant difference of change of ethical sensitivity by school year (F=2.704, p<.045). We expected ethical value and ethical sensitivity would change positively as the school year went up, but there was reluctance on the changes by school year. Improvements/Applications:: I suggest the ethical courses to develop various teaching procedures and education contents such as AI, VR, AR, and others in order to positively change ethical value and ethical sensitivity of students. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have heavily irrupted in society, bringing new applications and possibilities while introducing some ethical problems. Governments and institutions around the world are working on the challenges posed by AI in all aspects, from economy to education. Therefore, introducing AI-related content at school and exploring how this kind of content can be taught becomes mandatory. In this paper we carry out a bibliographic revision of previous works done on ML, and then describe an educational resource developed by the institution of the first two authors (INTEF) aimed to teach ML in schools with Scratch and Machine Learning for Kids. The testimonials of three educators, who have implemented their own version of these resources, are depicted. More efforts should be made to introduce AI-related content in education. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology has the potential of transforming how governments function, making them better able to serve, protect, and improve the quality of life of their constituents. As governments of developing countries continue to shift to more advanced digital platforms, they have adopted practices and policies that have a direct impact on the future of AI-based technology. This research aims to discuss factors that may have a direct impact on the AI preparedness of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries. It evaluates a recent ranking developed by the international development research center (IDRC) focused on indicators towards the development or use of AI technology in governance, infrastructure, technological skills, and public services against each country's economic metrics including unemployment rate, gross domestic product per capita purchasing power parity (GDP-PPP), cost to hire an AI researcher, and countrywide education levels. It also reviews metrics and factors outside of economics which have a direct impact on AI readiness and its effects on each country's citizens, including automation potential and data privacy policies. This research discusses current issues with existing evaluation criteria for AI readiness and expands factors and considerations essential to LAC countries as they embrace the AI revolution. © 2019 IEEE.

Explanatory learner models: Why machine learning (alone) is not the answer

DOI: 10.1111/bjet.12858
ABSTRACT: Using data to understand learning and improve education has great promise. However, the promise will not be achieved simply by AI and Machine Learning researchers developing innovative models that more accurately predict labeled data. As AI advances, modeling techniques and the models they produce are getting increasingly complex, often involving tens of thousands of parameters or more. Though strides towards interpretation of complex models are being made in core machine learning communities, it remains true in these cases of “black box” modeling that research teams may have little possibility to peer inside to try understand how, why, or even whether such models will work when applied beyond the data on which they were built. Rather than relying on AI expertise alone, we suggest that learning engineering teams bring interdisciplinary expertise to bear to develop explanatory learner models that provide interpretable and actionable insights in addition to accurate prediction. We describe examples that illustrate use of different kinds of data (eg, click stream and discourse data) in different course content (eg, math and writing) and toward different goals (eg, improving student models and generating actionable feedback). We recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Researchers in learning analytics and educational data mining have been successful in creating innovative models of data that optimize prediction. Some of these models produce scientific or practical insights and fewer have been put into use and demonstrated to enhance student learning. What this paper adds We provide examples of development of explanatory models of learners that not only accurately predict data but also provide scientific insights and yield practical outcomes. In particular, researchers with expertise in cognitive science and math education content use AI-based data analytics to discover previously unrecognized barriers to geometry student learning. They use model-derived insights to redesign an online tutoring system and “close-the-loop” by experimentally demonstrating that the new system produces better student learning than the original. Implications for practice and/or policy We define explanatory learning models and provide an articulation of a process for generating them that involves interdisciplinary teams employing human–computer interaction and learning engineering methods. Based on our experiences, we recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As technology has become ubiquitous in learning contexts, there has been an explosion in the amount of learning data. This creates opportunities to draw on the decades of learner modelling research from Artificial Intelligence in Education and more recent research on Personal Informatics. We use these bodies of research to introduce a conceptual model for a Personal User Model for Life-long, Life-wide Learners (PUMLs). We use this to define a core set of system competency questions. A successful PUML and its interface must enable a learner to answer these by scrutinising their PUML, aided by its scaffolding interfaces. We aim to give learners both control over their own learning data and the means to harness that data for the important metacognitive processes of self-monitoring, reflection and planning. We conclude with a set of design guidelines for creating PUMLs. Our core contribution is a way to think about the design and evaluation of learning data and applications so that they give learner control and agency beyond simple data access and algorithmic transparency. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic There is decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research on learner modelling, personalisation and Open Learner Models (OLMs). There is a growing body of work on Personal Informatics. What this paper adds Drawing on the above research, we present a conceptual model showing how learning applications and data repositories relate to a Personal User Model for Life-long, Life-wide Learners (PUMLs). A set of competency questions to inform design and evaluation of PUMLs. Guidelines for designing interfaces that enable learners to scrutinise and control their learning data and models. Implications for practice and/or policy As universities create institutional repositories of learning data, our work takes a complementary, learner-centred perspective of learning data, applications and repositories. PUMLs offer a mechanism to support student’s meta-cognitive processes. PUMLs go beyond simplistic views of data access and transparency of algorithmic processes—empowering learners to scrutinise their long-term data and its use. © 2019 British Educational Research Association

ABSTRACT: Interdisciplinary research from the learning sciences has helped us understand a great deal about the way that humans learn, and as a result we now have an improved understanding about how best to teach and train people. This same body of research must now be used to better inform the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for use in education and training. In this paper, we use three case studies to illustrate how learning sciences research can inform the judicious analysis, of rich, varied and multimodal data, so that it can be used to help us scaffold students and support teachers. Based on this increased understanding of how best to inform the analysis of data through the application of learning sciences research, we are better placed to design AI algorithms that can analyse rich educational data at speed. Such AI algorithms and technology can then help us to leverage faster, more nuanced and individualised scaffolding for learners. However, most commercial AI developers know little about learning sciences research, indeed they often know little about learning or teaching. We therefore argue that in order to ensure that AI technologies for use in education and training embody such judicious analysis and learn in a learning sciences informed manner, we must develop inter-stakeholder partnerships between AI developers, educators and researchers. Here, we exemplify our approach to such partnerships through the EDUCATE Educational Technology (EdTech) programme. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic? The progress of AI Technology and learning analytics lags behind the adoption of these approaches and technologies in other fields such as medicine or finance. Data are central to the empirical work conducted in the learning sciences and to the development of machine learning Artificial Intelligence (AI). Education is full of doubts about the value that any technology can bring to the teaching and learning process. What this paper adds? We argue that the learning sciences have an important role to play in the design of educational AI, through their provision of theories that can be operationalised and advanced. Through case studies, we illustrate that the analysis of data appropriately informed by interdisciplinary learning sciences research can be used to power AI educational technology. We provide a framework for inter-stakeholder, interdisciplinary partnerships that can help educators better understand AI, and AI developers better understand education. Implications for practice and/or policy? AI is here to stay and that it will have an increasing impact on the design of technology for use in education and training. Data, which is the power behind machine learning AI, can enable analysis that can vastly increase our understanding of when and how the teaching and learning process is progressing positively. Inter-stakeholder, interdisciplinary partnerships must be used to make sure that AI provides some of the educational benefits its application in other areas promise us. © 2019 British Educational Research Association

ABSTRACT: Digital data are transforming higher education (HE) to be more student-focused and metrics-centred. In the UK, capturing detailed data about students has become a government priority, with an emphasis on using student data to measure, compare and assess university performance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the governmental and commercial drivers of current large-scale technological efforts to collect and analyse student data in UK HE. The result is an expanding data infrastructure which includes large-scale and longitudinal datasets, learning analytics services, student apps, data dashboards and digital learning platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Education data scientists have built positive pedagogic cases for student data analysis, learning analytics and AI. The politicization and commercialization of the wider HE data infrastructure is translating them into performance metrics in an increasingly market-driven sector, raising the need for policy frameworks for ethical, pedagogically valuable uses of student data in HE. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Learning analytics, education data science and artificial intelligence are opening up new ways of collecting and analysing student data in higher education. UK government policies emphasize the use of student data for improvements to teaching and learning. What this paper adds A conceptual framework from “infrastructure studies” demonstrates how political objectives and commercial aims are fused to HE data systems, with data infrastructure becoming a key tool of government reform. A critical infrastructure analysis shows that student data processing technologies are being developed and deployed to measure university performance through student data. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators and managers in universities need to prepare robust institutional frameworks to govern their use of student data. Learning analytics practitioners, data scientists, learning scientists and social science researchers need to collaborate with the policy community and education technology developers on new policy frameworks to challenge narrow uses of student data as performance metrics. © 2019 British Educational Research Association

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence and data analysis (AIDA) are increasingly entering the field of education. Within this context, the subfield of learning analytics (LA) has, since its inception, had a strong emphasis upon ethics, with numerous checklists and frameworks proposed to ensure that student privacy is respected and potential harms avoided. Here, we draw attention to some of the assumptions that underlie previous work in ethics for LA, which we frame as three tensions. These assumptions have the potential of leading to both the overcautious underuse of AIDA as administrators seek to avoid risk, or the unbridled misuse of AIDA as practitioners fail to adhere to frameworks that provide them with little guidance upon the problems that they face in building LA for institutional adoption. We use three edge cases to draw attention to these tensions, highlighting places where existing ethical frameworks fail to inform those building LA solutions. We propose a pilot open database that lists edge cases faced by LA system builders as a method for guiding ethicists working in the field towards places where support is needed to inform their practice. This would provide a middle space where technical builders of systems could more deeply interface with those concerned with policy, law and ethics and so work towards building LA that encourages human flourishing across a lifetime of learning. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Applied ethics has a number of well-established theoretical groundings that we can use to frame the actions of ethical agents, including, deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics. Learning analytics has developed a number of checklists, frameworks and evaluation methodologies for supporting trusted and ethical development, but these are often not adhered to by practitioners. Laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) apply to fields like education, but the complexity of this field can make them difficult to apply. What this paper adds Evidence of tensions and gaps in existing ethical frameworks and checklists to support the ethical development and implementation of learning analytics. A set of three edge cases that demonstrate places where existing work on the ethics of AI in education has failed to provide guidance. A “practical ethics” conceptualisation that draws on virtue ethics to support practitioners in building learning analytics systems. Implications for practice and/or policy Those using AIDA in education should collect and share example edge cases to support development of practical ethics in the field. A multiplicity of ethical approaches are likely to be useful in understanding how to develop and implement learning analytics ethically in practical contexts. © 2019 British Educational Research Association

ABSTRACT: The question: “What is an appropriate role for AI?” is the subject of much discussion and interest. Arguments about whether AI should be a human replacing technology or a human assisting technology frequently take centre stage. Education is no exception when it comes to questions about the role that AI should play, and as with many other professional areas, the exact role of AI in education is not easy to predict. Here, we argue that one potential role for AI in education is to provide opportunities for human intelligence augmentation, with AI supporting us in decision-making processes, rather than replacing us through automation. To provide empirical evidence to support our argument, we present a case study in the context of debate tutoring, in which we use prediction and classification models to increase the transparency of the intuitive decision-making processes of expert tutors for advanced reflections and feedback. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of unimodal and multimodal classification models of expert human tutors' decisions about the social and emotional aspects of tutoring while evaluating trainees. Our results show that multimodal data leads to more accurate classification models in the context we studied. © 2019 British Educational Research Association

ABSTRACT: The expansion of possibilities drawn to individuals and institutions by the latest technological advancements is so far-reaching that reframing our everyday life according to new assets and tangible wills is no more an easy task. Even if we restrict the context and think on the challenges of introducing Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) the horizon is still wide. But which society layers are being involved in the process of conceiving AIEd scope and what kind of debates are gaining traction in terms of AIEd potential, concerns, implications and contextual meaning? And, finally, what are the frameworks being considered in terms of the ethical challenges posed to the experience of learning itself? Committed with this context, this research will focus the ethical challenges of AI, in what concerns the signification of a learning experience in formal education, regarding the capacity to collect sense from content and stimuli. The Cultural-Historical Activity Theory will give the proper background to the understanding of the learning experience through the lens of control and agency. Throughout the research it will be explored if and how ethical impact assessment of AIEd (1) influences primary teachers' capacity to design learning sequences that intentionally and systematically address the challenges AI poses to learning signification processes, (2) benefiting students' critical thinking upon AI. A comprehensive socio-constructivist approach to an eLearning course is expected to contribute to teachers' capacity to intentionally explore the potential and limits of using AI in their systematic pedagogical action for the holistic development of their students. © 2019 ACM.

ABSTRACT: The use of AI is becoming a growing reality the educational field. One of the activities in which it is beginning to be implemented is the assessment of student achievement. This way, we can find in the literature an increasing number of investigations focused on the possibilities offered by the adoption of AI-driven assessment. However, the use of AI is also a source of concern that raises suspicions in some sectors of our society. In this context, knowing the position of the teachers towards this topic is critical to guarantee the successful development of the field. This paper intends to fill a research gap in the literature by offering a technology adoption model based on TAM to study the factors that condition the use of AI-driven assessment among teachers. To present this model we offer a background on the use of AI in education and the technology acceptance among teachers, as well as the definition of the eight constructs and the relational hypotheses included. Finally, the possibilities of the model and future lines of research are discussed. © 2019 ACM.

ABSTRACT: This Innovative Practice Work in Progress paper presents a novel educational project, aiming at the development and implementation of a professional, standardized, internationally accepted system for training and certifying teachers, school students and young people in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics. In recent years, AI and Robotics have become major topics with a huge impact not only on our everyday life but also on the working environment. Hence, sound knowledge about principles and concepts of AI and Robotics are key skills for the 21st century. Nonetheless, hardly any systematic approaches exist that focus on teaching AI/Robotics principles at K-12 level, addressing both teachers and students. In order to meet this challenge, the European Driving License for Robots and Intelligent Systems is under development. It is based on a number of previously implemented and evaluated projects and comprises teaching curricula and training modules for AI/Robotics, following a competency based, blended learning approach. Additionally, a certification system proves peoples' competencies acquired during the training. By applying this innovative approach - a standardized and widely recognized training and certification system for AI and Robotics at K-12 level for both teachers and students - we envision to foster AI/Robotics literacy on a broad basis. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: A major challenge for Education 4.0 is to make use of wearable devices for helping students in monitoring their learning behavior and their activities (steps, heart rate variability, and heart rate) in real-time. The first aim of this paper is to present our implementation of adaptivity and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods within the Education 4.0 process. In this work, we investigate embedded biosensors (noninvasive, low-cost, and distraction-free) used in smartphones and smartwatches. The next objective is to enable IoT for Higher Education, i.e. a novel system assisted by AI that takes embedded biosensor data and environmental data into account in order to estimate students' wellbeing and health. In this regard, we propose a framework that uses wearable devices to collect data with biofeedback methods to support students' academic success. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Indian languages are spoken by more than 90% of its population while most of the higher education happens in English medium. The policy makers in Indian government have realized that by introducing multilingual education electronically, they can reach out to the remotest corner of India and educate all in their mother tongue. The New Education Policy (NEP) draft just released by the government puts a heavy focus on mother tongues in education. The recent initiatives and focus on Natural Language Processing/ Artificial Intelligence (NLP/AI) in education through e-learning is not too surprising in this context. The paper presents the current initiatives in these directions by the government of India, surveys available NLP technologies particularly those for automatic translation of educational content developed by academia and industry and focuses on the Maithili language community. India's education needs are diverse and the success of e-learning depends heavily on the availability of necessary NLP tools in all languages. Almost all of major scheduled Indian languages are considered "resource-poor". While some of these languages may have the basic tools, they lack quality translation tools for delivering education in native language. The situation is more challenging in those languages where even the most basic resources and tools do not exist. Maithili-a language of Bihar and Nepal is such a language. The paper also presents an effort to develop MT resources and tools for Maithili and its application in delivering multilingual content for education. © BEIESP.

ABSTRACT: The emerging data-driven economy (also defined as Industry 4.0 or simply 4IR), encompassing industry, research and business, requires new types of specialists that are able to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input, to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be collectively defined as the Data Science family of professions. Data Science as a research and academic discipline provides a basis for Data Analytics and ML/AI applications. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data-driven research and the digital economy. In the modern era, with ever faster technology changes, matched by strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training programme should be customizable and deliverable in multiple forms, tailored for different categories of professional roles and profiles. Referring to other publications by the authors on building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains, this paper is focused on defining a set of transversal competences and skills that are required from modern and future Data Science professions. These include workplace and professional skills that cover critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The proposed approach is based on the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) initially developed within the EU funded Project EDISON and currently being further developed in the EU funded MATES project and also the FAIRsFAIR projects. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Introduction:This study is a prospective, assessor-blinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled pilot trial to explore the effectiveness of 12-week adjuvant moxibustion therapy for arthralgia in menopausal females at stage I to III breast cancer on aromatase inhibitor (AI) administration, compared with those receiving usual care.Methods/design:Forty-six menopausal female patients with breast cancer who completed cancer therapy will be randomly allocated to either adjuvant moxibustion or usual care groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention group will undergo 24 sessions of adjuvant moxibustion therapy with usual care for 12 weeks, whereas the control group will receive only usual care during the same period. The usual care consists of acetaminophen administration on demand and self-directed exercise education to manage AI-related joint pain. The primary outcome is the mean change of the worst pain level according to the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form between the initial visit and the endpoint. The mean changes in depression, fatigue, and quality of life will also be compared between groups. Safety and pharmacoeconomic evaluations will also be included.Discussion:Continuous variables will be compared by an independent t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the adjuvant moxibustion and usual care groups. Adverse events will be analyzed using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. The statistical analysis will be performed by a 2-tailed test at a significance level of.05. © 2019 the Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Machine learning (ML) allows the exploration and progressive improvement of very complex high-dimensional data patterns that can be utilised to optimise specific classification and prediction tasks, outperforming traditional statistical approaches. An enormous acceleration of ready-to-use tools and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, shaped by the emergence, refinement, and application of powerful ML algorithms in several areas of knowledge, is ongoing. Although such progress has begun to permeate the medical sciences and clinical medicine, implementation in cardiovascular medicine and research is still in its infancy. Objectives: To lay out the theoretical framework, purpose, and structure of a novel AI consortium. Methods: We have established a new Dutch research consortium, the CVON-AI, supported by the Netherlands Heart Foundation, to catalyse and facilitate the development and utilisation of AI solutions for existing and emerging cardiovascular research initiatives and to raise AI awareness in the cardiovascular research community. CVON-AI will connect to previously established CVON consortia and apply a cloud-based AI platform to supplement their planned traditional data-analysis approach. Results: A pilot experiment on the CVON-AI cloud was conducted using cardiac magnetic resonance data. It demonstrated the feasibility of the platform and documented excellent correlation between AI-generated ventricular function estimates as compared to expert manual annotations. The resulting AI solution was then integrated in a web application. Conclusion: CVON-AI is a new consortium meant to facilitate the implementation and raise awareness of AI in cardiovascular research in the Netherlands. CVON-AI will create an accessible cloud-based platform for cardiovascular researchers, demonstrate the clinical applicability of AI, optimise the analytical methodology of other ongoing CVON consortia, and promote AI awareness through education and training. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, artificial intelligence (AI) analytics are useful as educational scaffolds to educe (draw out) the students’ AI-Thinking skills in the form of AI-assisted human-centric reasoning for the development of knowledge and competencies. This paper demonstrates how STEAM learners, rather than computer scientists, can use AI to predictively simulate how concrete mixture inputs might affect the output of compressive strength under different conditions (e.g., lack of water and/or cement, or different concrete compressive strengths required for art creations). To help STEAM learners envision how AI can assist them in human-centric reasoning, two AI-based approaches will be illustrated: first, a Naïve Bayes approach for supervised machine-learning of the dataset, which assumes no direct relations between the mixture components; and second, a semi-supervised Bayesian approach to machine-learn the same dataset for possible relations between the mixture components. These AI-based approaches enable controlled experiments to be conducted in-silico, where selected parameters could be held constant, while others could be changed to simulate hypothetical “what-if” scenarios. In applying AI to think discursively, AI-Thinking can be educed from the STEAM learners, thereby improving their AI literacy, which in turn enables them to ask better questions to solve problems. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Cloud computing offers developers of learning environments access to unprecedented amounts of learner data. This makes possible data-driven development (D3) of learning environments. In the D3 approach the learning environment is a data collection tool as well a learning tool. It continually collects data from interactions with learners, which is used in ongoing evaluation and iterative development. Iterative development cycles become very rapid, limited by the time required to analyze data and deploy system updates. D3 is particularly relevant to fielded AIED systems that operate in uncontrolled conditions, where learners may behave in unexpected ways. This article presents two snapshot case studies in the data-driven development of Enskill® English, a system for learning to speak English as a foreign language. In the first trial at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia two versions of Enskill English’s dialogue system were tested simultaneously: the released version and a new version incorporating statistical natural language processing technology. A new version was released and data were collected from a second snapshot evaluation at the University of Split, Croatia. Data from learners in Latin America and Europe were analyzed for comparison. The evaluations provided preliminary evidence that Enskill English is helpful for learning spoken English skills, and leading indicators that learner performance improves through practice with Enskill English. They suggest that Enskill English can be extended to meet the needs of more advanced learners who wish to use English in a professional context. Broader recommendations for data-driven development of intelligent learning environments are presented. © 2019, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: The advancement in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence has posed challenges and opportunities for undergraduate education. It raises several questions regarding what is desirable and viable for preparing undergraduate students for future success. This paper presents the rationales and outcomes of a two-year reform of an undergraduate program of Internet and New Media in China, summarizing the ways in which the curriculum design can incorporate Big Data and Artificial Intelligence education for future Internet product managers and HCI professionals. Using the notion of “minimum viable products” to frame the action research of education reform, it first describes the ways in which we identify the job market need for Internet product managers and HCI professionals, and explores the learning pathways, departing from the conventional Internet and New Media programs in China. It then documents the results of the minimum required changes to deliver such a viable learning product and the initial evidence from students that validates the designed learning product. The overall findings demonstrate the usefulness and challenges in preparing students for careers in a data-intensive or data-driven world. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a course design, named Algorithms in Game AI, as an undergraduate elective course. The course mainly focuses on common and state-of-the-art algorithms in the game AI area, including game tree based algorithms and reinforcement learning. Powered by Botzone, our game AI platform, we designed different types of assignments for this course to bring a rich and fun learning experience.We chose several games including two popular Chinese classic ones, namely Mahjong and FightTheLandlord, which are both collaborative, stochastic and partially observable. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to adopt these games in AI courses, thus providing a new benchmark for game AI education. To encourage participation and reduce frustration, milestone-based competitions and bonus tasks were adopted. In this paper, we present the structure, teaching tools, techniques, performance and findings of this course. By reviewing students' performance and feedback, we found that students enjoyed the games we provided. We also found that reinforcement learning algorithms did not perform as well as other algorithms in limited time and resources. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

ABSTRACT: We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children’s perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

ABSTRACT: Given the growing demand for and trends in economic and social reforms, adaptive and creative generations are needed. In the Malaysian context, one of the greatest challenges entails motivation to pursue Arts Education, especially within the formal education sector. For the majority of the affected countries, one of the promising solutions involves the promotion of collaboration between schools and artists. This collaboration entails the sharing of experiences and ideas between the concerned parties. In this study, the main aim was to explore the motivation of secondary school students towards pursuing Visual Arts Education. The target program that was investigated involved “Artists in Schools (AiS),” a collaborative program. Participants involved nine artists and nine schools. Participant registration was achieved via a website established by the researcher. Regarding a face-to-face interview session that was held, one student was selected from each school. From the perspective of the research design, the study involved multiple case studies. The objective was to discover new information regarding the motivation of the students. Hence, the data collection process involved secondary data, direct observation, and conducting interviews. The theoretical framework that guided the review of literature and inference-making processes involved Keller's ARCS Motivational Theory. Form the results, AiS plays an instrumental role towards the enhancement and encouragement of students' motivation in arts; translating into improved creativity among the learners. © BEIESP.

ABSTRACT: Currently, the market for Korean language education is over 4 trillion won, and 20 trillion yen in Japan and 50 trillion in China.Traditional markets used to learn languages through native speaker, such as offline academies, burns, English, etc. In addition, in the case of English, it has become just a subject for studying for tests, not only to communicate.This causes pressure on young people, resulting in poor learning efficiency. To learn language as a means of communication, the environment needs to be created in order to acquire language. There are the language learning programs in the virtual reality environment. such as 'Learn Languages VR by Mondly' and 'House of Language VR'. In the case of Learn Languages program, it supports many environment and teaches many different languages. However, depending on the stated scenario, the degree of freedom of speech is low.In the case of ' House of Language VR' program, the degree of freedom of speech is significantly reduced by matching words to words. Also, it is less realistic because it is in progress through animation programs produced for infants.In learning languages, learning to speaking in a real-life situation with native speakers is required for advanced skill.In this study, we intend to produce a learning program using VR devices and interacting with native speakers. © 2019 Global IT Research Institute (GIRI).

ABSTRACT: The development of simple and effective tools for selective ratiometric detection of hypochlorite (ClO − ) is one of the most important goals for elucidating the biofunction of ClO − in associated diseases. However, most developmental probes suffer from the notorious aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect that greatly limits their applications. Herein, we report on novel aggregation-induced emission dots (AIED) for ratiometric detection of ClO − via a co-precipitation strategy. The AIED nanoprobe displayed a ratiometric signal output, which was more promising to minimize the bad environmental factors and simultaneously avoided the ACQ effect. Notably, amphiphilic block copolymer endowed the nanoprobe with stable water dispersibility and easy modification. The as-prepared AIED probe exhibited high sensitivity (~ 89 nM), high selectivity, outstanding photostability, and prominent long-term fluorescence stability. Furthermore, the as-prepared AIED was applied for the visualized fluorescence detection of ClO − and further utilized to detect ClO − in real samples. We expect the nanoprobe to be an outstanding tool to understand ClO − -associated diseases. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A defining aspect of our modern age is our tenacious belief in technology in all walks of life, not least in education. It could be argued that this infatuation with technology or ‘techno-philia’ in education has had a deep impact in the classroom changing the relationship between teacher and student, as well as between students; that is, these relations have become increasingly more I–It than I–Thou based because the capacity to form bonds, the level of connectedness between teacher and students, and between students has either decreased or become impaired by the increasing technologisation of education. Running parallel to this and perhaps exacerbating the problem is the so-called process of ‘learnification’, which understands that teachers are mere facilitators of the learning process, rather than someone with an expertise who has something to teach others. In this article, I first assess the current technologisation of education and the impact it has had in relations within the classroom; second, I characterise Buber’s I–It and I–Thou relations and its implications for education; finally, I investigate through a thought experiment if the development of AI could 1 day successfully replace human teachers in the classroom. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.

ABSTRACT: Patient education on the risks associated with the concurrent consumption of alcohol and medications is an integral part of patient teaching. Results of this pilot study suggest nurses should be given continuing education opportunities to review alcohol-interactive medication content and equip themselves with essential skills to help prevent alcohol-related adverse drug reactions.
Background Alcohol affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of certain medications and increases risk of adverse drug reactions. Nurses need a functional knowledge of alcohol-interactive (AI) medications to provide adequate patient education. Aims To measure registered nurses’ (RNs) knowledge of AI medications and determine if work environment, years in nursing practice, and level of formal education contribute to AI medication knowledge. Method This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and a convenience sample of 211 RNs employed by a large midwestern health system. A 30- item survey was developed for this study with questions about 15 oftenprescribed medications and their interactions with alcohol. Findings Nurses correctly identified 56.3% of medications as AI or non-AI. No statistically significant relationship was found between AI medication knowledge and level of education, work environment, or years in nursing. Limitations and Implications Single-site convenience sampling and potential acquiescence bias limit generalizability. The face validity of the piloted survey was determined by only a small group of experts; however, internal consistency was high (a=0.90) for this sample. Conclusion Although results should be interpreted with caution, findings suggest more AI medication content should be incorporated into nursing curricula and continuing education so nurses can educate patients better about the risks of concurrent alcohol-drug consumption. © 2019, Anthony J.

ABSTRACT: In May 2018, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) formed a joint working group to develop national guidelines for teaching K-12 students about artificial intelligence [1]. Inspired by CSTA's national standards for K-12 computing education [2], the AI for K-12 guidelines (ai4k12.org) will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI-related videos, demo software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. The goal of this session is to raise the SIGCSE community's awareness of the initiative, its deliverables, and outcomes, and to foster a community-wide conversation about AI education in K-12. This initiative parallels other recent initiatives in K-12 AI education and community-wide initiatives and discussions around CS For All and CS in K-12. This Special Session is aimed toward K-12 CS educators, researchers, and curriculum and tool designers. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

ABSTRACT: Rational design of novel ratiometric and targetable fluorescent probes for selective imaging of lysosomal hypochlorous acid (HClO) is conducive to investigating the function of HClO in pathophysiological processes. Herein, we for the first time combine 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde (with a π-π stacking effect) and 2-methylquinoline derivatives to synthesize an aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) probe (SA-C2-PCD) for ratiometric detection of HClO in living cells. Subsequently, a kind of novel lysosome-targetable AIE dot (AIED-Lyso) with dual emission features is prepared via a simple co-precipitation of a lysosome-targeting surfactant MAA-CO720, an amphiphilic block copolymer PEO113-b-PS46 and the HClO-responsive probe (SA-C2-PCD). The free AIED-Lyso shows only strong red AIE fluorescence without addition of HClO. However, when exposed to HClO, a strong oxidizing agent, the SA-C2-PCD would release 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde that aggregates through π-π stacking interaction in aqueous solutions, inducing a distinct fluorescence change from red to blue. Interestingly, the as-prepared AIED-Lyso displays good water dispersity, high selectivity and sensitivity (∼70.4 nM), strong anti-interference ability, prominent long-term fluorescence stability (&gt;10 weeks), and low cytotoxicity, and it can be successfully applied to visually detect endogenous lysosomal HClO in live cells. © 2018 the Partner Organisations.

ABSTRACT: The recent advancement in the field of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) has led education innovators to design and deploy a series of learning technology solutions and assessment models for the entire K-16 education spectrum and beyond. With increasing investments from the private sector, numerous companies have launched solutions that are claimed to help almost all stakeholders in the education ecosystem. While the ultimate implications and the scope of these emerging solutions on online education and especially MOOCs remain unclear at this time, they nonetheless call for scholarly discussions at multiple levels. In an attempt to explore ways to understand and leverage AI and relevant features designed to promote higher-order learning and enable assessment strategies involving new types of future learning activities, we discuss some of the notable innovation examples integrating AI and their future potentials in education. In addition, we discuss some of the AI-based scaffolding and assessment tools now in development. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Our university is currently developing an advanced physical-digital learning environment that can train students to enhance their presentation and discussion skills. The environment guarantees an efficient presentation and discussion among users with state-of-the-art technologies such as touch panel digital poster panels. It includes an automatic evaluation system that efficiently records, analyses, and evaluates the presenter's presentation and discussion skills. We also have developed a digital poster authoring tool, a novel tool for creating interactive digital posters displayed on the digital poster panels. The environment also allows the students for effective self-training of presentation by authoring digital posters and getting feedbacks of automatic evaluation of presentation. We call such education promoted by the AI technologies “AI-Powered Education.” © 2019 ITE and SID

ABSTRACT: Focusing on students’ presentations and discussions in laboratory seminars, this book presents case studies on evidence-based education using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It proposes a system to help users complete research activities, and a machine-learning method that makes the system suitable for long-term operation by performing data mining for discussions and automatically extracting essential tasks. By illustrating the complete process - proposal, implementation, and operation - of applying machine learning techniques to real-world situations, the book will inspire researchers and professionals to develop innovative new applications for education. The book is divided into six chapters, the first of which provides an overview of AI research and practice in education. In turn, Chapter 2 describes a mechanism for applying data analytics to student discussions and utilizing the results for knowledge creation activities such as research. Based on discussion data analytics, Chapter 3 describes a creative activity support system that effectively utilizes the analytical results of the discussion for subsequent activities. Chapter 4 discusses the incorporation of a gamification method to evaluate and improve discussion skills while maintaining the motivation to participate in the discussion. Chapters 5 and 6 describe an advanced learning environment for honing students’ discussion and presentation skills. Two important systems proposed here are a presentation training system using virtual reality technologies, and an interactive presentation/discussion training system using a humanoid robot. In the former, the virtual space is constructed by measuring the three-dimensional shape of the actual auditorium, presentations are performed in the same way as in the real world, and the AI as audience automatically evaluates the presentation and provides feedback. In the latter, a humanoid robot makes some remarks on and asks questions about students’ presentations, and the students practice responding to it. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

ABSTRACT: The ubiquity of AI in society means the time is ripe to consider what educated 21st century digital citizens should know about this subject. In May 2018, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) formed a joint working group to develop national guidelines for teaching AI to K-12 students. Inspired by CSTA's national standards for K-12 computing education, the AI for K-12 guidelines will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The AI for K-12 working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI-related videos, demos, software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. This blue sky talk invites the AI research community to reflect on the big ideas in AI that every K-12 student should know, and how we should communicate with the public about advances in AI and their future impact on society. It is a call to action for more AI researchers to become AI educators, creating resources that help teachers and students understand our work. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

ABSTRACT: Minor education is a foundation of our country. But now the unbalance of education in different areas causes serious problems. Recently, the usage of artificial intelligence in various fields provides new solutions to some traditional difficulties. With the development of education and artificial intelligence, the relationship between 1+N education and multimedia networks is closer. Intelligent algorithms can extract information that can instruct teaching behavior from educational videos and audios. This paper first analyzes the necessity and meanings of teacher pose estimation in classroom videos. Then a new multimedia network architecture is proposed. The network is fully connected with MobilenetV2 as the backbone. It also uses feature pyramid network for feature fusion. Compared with other algorithms, our new network architecture has obvious advantages in speed. And experiment results prove its advantages in speed and good performances. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A gap has emerged in teaching artificial intelligence (AI) in business education, where a style of curriculum based on strategy is missing. This article presents a new framework, the 3S Process, as a method for teaching leaders how to strategically adopt AI within their organizations. At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution. The presentation of the 3S Process in this article is conceptual. Further empirical studies, including evaluations of the 3S Process in classroom settings, will be considered in the future. © 2019 Carleton University. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the creation of a smart machine that has human behaviour and response. AI in the education sector is able to interact, assist, and guide students through Self-Exploration Education (SEE) in Self Determined Learning (SDL) or Heutagogical technique, such as current, but semi-automatic learning systems. Malaysian higher education institutions are forced to adapt to such a radical change in order to stay competitive and fulfill their stakeholder needs. Everyone is born as a genius, with curiosity to explore the environment through experiments. This study examines the effect of SDL on SEE in Tangible Mixed-Reality Learning System until 2030. It does that under two different lenses: First, the effect on the value proposition and the business models of the SDL. Second, it identifies hurdles for the implementation and draws strategic implications for the SDL Tangible Mixed-Reality Learning System. However, in practice, SEE is still very much focused on spreading facts rather than encouraging personal exploration. Conducting exploration of learning in the classroom can be complicated for adult learning or andragogy and is limited by virtue, money and work infrastructure. But what if we can create a middle ground between learning and fiction, the world in which adults learn and explore in ways that may be impossible in real life but still true to the transfer of knowledge? The project is to craft an imaginative and accessible tool to help adults develop scientific minds and practices through self-exploration or Do-it-yourself DIY with a mixed reality learning system that empowers adults to know the invisible and investigate hard through exploration. By 2030 the likeliest scenario is that fully Self-Exploration is solely available for particularly high-value use cases, affecting the value proposition toward provision of education services, an increase of stakeholder and value-centric value propositions fostered by continuous interactions between the Heutagogical technique and the stakeholder. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As technology increases day by day, humans also change their lifestyle and the way they react to the situations. When mobile phones came into existence people are excited to use them and they show interest in them. In recent days mobile phones replaced cameras, laptops, visit shopping zone, buying books, watching television and even talking with our near and dear. The situation has aroused that without a company of mobile, an individual becomes deserted from the information. Mobile Technology has deep-rooted even in the field of education and Mobile learning helps to sustain in today’s world. It involves the ability to communicate as well as access to learning resources and makes the educational system to develop. The essential fundamental piece of mobile learning is to make students independent form their formal education system that are pressurizing students and that prepare students fail in gaining knowledge. This change in classroom teaching and management through mobile has revolutionized education and the future is prompted towards virtual education and Artificial Intelligence in Education where teacher-learner interphase will be unimaginable. Introducing Mobile Learning among Engineering under Graduates students will be optimum as they would be much interested in quitting the use of paper, printed documents and writing material in day-to-day classes. On the other hand, introducing the Learning Management System will be helpful for teachers to maintain and manage massive data related to testing and assessing examinations conducted throughout the semester just by using their mobiles. LMS and other digital tools used for teaching and learning are available in the play store as apps. Many apps are functional and more related to the course of study of engineering graduates. They also serve them with ample resources. Hence the mobile phone will act as a reservoir for both the students and teachers to get integrated and to stay connected off the classes as well. This paper discloses the current trends of mobile learning in school education, higher education, future growth and challenges through detailed study. This will be very helpful for readers to understand the feasibility of introducing mobile learning concepts among various levels of education but specifically to higher education institutes. It will also reveal how the introduction of disruptive technologies in education will bring a change in the learning and teaching process, which will leave a way for acquiring advanced technologies in the near future. © Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

ABSTRACT: New technology tends to invite speculation on the future of societies, inspiring visions of both hope and horror. This chapter continues that tradition, exploring the application of emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to processes of governance and learning in education. Drawing on both utopian visions and twin nightmares of machinic-dystopias, the analysis reflects on the application of new technology designed to fulfill the UN’s post-2015 agenda in education. In highlighting divergent traditions, the analysis then shifts to the application of the same technology in China as part of the Chinese Dream, under which the Chinese government aims to become the world leader in AI while revitalizing the nation’s cultural traditions. These ambitions are explored through the introduction of Smart Cities, a system of Social Credit, and Smart Schools. Finally, the chapter reflects on these visions of twenty-first century pedagogy and possible resources for thinking about a future that cannot be fully apprehended. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: high risk HPV is the perpetrator of cervical cancer disease, however screening and vaccination is not included in cervical cancer prevention program within public hospitals in Kenya. This descriptive study assessed the association of specific microbial STI and socio-demographic characteristics and practices with cervical cytomorphologic presentations in regards to pre cervical cancer grades amongst health seeking patients attending the reproductive health clinic of Nakuru County referral hospital, a public hospital under newly devolved health services governance. Methods: a total of 142 patients (AGC/AIS, n=8; HSIL, n=59; LSIL, n=35; controls, n=40) whose median age ranged between 20-70 years were purposively sampled. A structured questionnaire with closed and open ended entries was administered and STI screening including Pap smear examination for cytomorphological profiling done according to revised 2014 Bethesda classification. Associations were established using chi-square and multivariate logistic regression model to determine prediction of cervical atypia manifestations. Results: a majority of the study participants had only primary education or no education in AGC/AIS (63%) and HSIL (73%) relative to LSIL (49%) and controls (53%) (P=0.017). Koilocyte rates were higher in AGC/AIS (25%), HSIL (52%) and LSIL (77%) compared controls (12.5%) (P<0.0001). ASCUS predominated in HSIL (61%) and LSIL (86%), while almost all AGC/AIS had AGCUS (88%). HR HPV 16/18 infection rates were higher in AGC/AIS (100%), HSIL (80%) and LSIL (83%) relative to controls (10%) (P<0.0001), and was associated with higher risk of having AGC/AIS (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.940-1.947; P<0.0001); HSIL, (OR, 36.3; 95% CI, 9.5-139.5; P<0.0001); and LSIL (OR, 50.1; 95% CI, 12.0-209.0; P<0.0001). Conclusion: altogether, pre-cervical cancer in Kenyan women is characterized by koilocytosis and ASCUS probably from the high rates of HPV 16/18 infections. Promoting cancer education and screening for high risk HPV infections and pre-cancerous lesions will improve women's reproductive health. © Esther Muitta et al.

ABSTRACT: This research presents a new, socially adaptive robot tutor, Ms. An (Meeting Students’ Academic Needs). The goal of this research was to use a decision tree model to develop a socially adaptive robot tutor that predicted and responded to student emotion and performance to actively engage students in mathematics education. The novelty of this multi-disciplinary project is the combination of the fields of HRI, AI, and education. In this study we (1) implemented a decision tree model to classify student emotion and performance for use in adaptive robot tutoring-an approach not applied to educational robotics; (2) presented an intuitive interface for seamless robot operation by novice users; and (3) applied direct human teaching methods (guided practice and progress monitoring) for a robot tutor to engage students in mathematics education. Twenty 4th and 5th grade students in rural South Carolina participated in a between subjects study with two conditions: (A) with a non-adaptive robot (control group); and (B) with a socially adaptive robot (adaptive group). Students engaged in two one-on-one tutoring sessions to practice multiplication per the South Carolina 4th and 5th grade mathematics state standards. Although our decision tree models were not very predictive, the results gave answers to our current questions and clarity for future directions. Our adaptive strategies to engage students academically were effective. Further, all students enjoyed working with the robot and we did not see a difference in emotional engagement across the two groups. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Learning context has evident to be an essential part in vocabulary development, however describing learning context for each vocabulary is considered to be difficult. In the human brain, it is relatively easy to describe learning contexts using pictures because pictures describe an immense amount of details at a quick glance that text annotations cannot do. Therefore, in an informal language learning system, pictures can be used to overcome the problems that language learners face in describing learning contexts. The present study aimed to develop a support system that generates and represents learning contexts automatically by analyzing the visual contents of the pictures captured by language learners. Automatic image captioning, a technology of artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing is used for analyzing the visual contents of the learners’ captured images. A neural image caption generator model called Show and Tell is trained for image-to-word generation and to describe the context of an image. The three-fold objectives of this research are: First, an intelligent technology that can understand the contents of the picture and capable to generate learning contexts automatically; Second, a leaner can learn multiple vocabularies by using one picture without relying on a representative picture for each vocabulary, and Third, a learner’s prior vocabulary knowledge can be mapped with new learning vocabulary so that previously acquired vocabulary be reviewed and recalled while learning new vocabulary. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Smart education is one of the main applications of Smart cities which requires artificial intelligence-based models during the education process. Optimizing the educational contents to match the student's capabilities and backgrounds is one of the core tasks in the smart educations. To improve the optimization of an education system, a data mining algorithm is used to classify and summarize the education data and improve the accuracy of teaching content. An optimization and updating scheme is put forward from the algorithm flow and evaluation model, and an adequate evaluation model is established by effectively evaluating the developing state of wisdom education. In the test of intelligent education model, the efficiency of AI education and the data accuracy of the data mining algorithm are tested. The test results show that the integration of AI can improve the efficiency of learning and teaching, and make the teaching content more accurate, which is worth to further promoting. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

ABSTRACT: Gaps in adult literacy present major barriers to personal and economic development. In-person adult education has leveraged AI systems to personalize the educational experience, but existing family literacy education programs are often difficult for parents to complete. In this paper, we reframe parents as literacy learners as a rich opportunity for AIED systems to support parents learning literacy with their children. We synthesize prior literature and outline a set of design considerations and design directions for AIED systems to provide unique supports for parents as literacy learners. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an emerging trend in different fields: science, business, medicine, automotive and education. AI has also reached marketing. The aim of the paper is to research how deeply AI is applied in marketing and what implications there are for marketing practitioners. Authors stated two research questions - which areas of AI are used in marketing and what implications AI delivers for marketing managers. To answer those questions, the authors conducted research on secondary data with AI examples used for marketing purpose. The analysis of gathered examples shows that AI is widely introduced into the marketing field, though the applications are at the operational level. This may be the effect of careful implementation of the new technology, still at the level of experimenting with it. The uncertainty of the outcome of AI implementation may affect the caution in putting these innovations into practice as well. Gathered examples proved that AI influences all aspects of marketing mix impacting both consumer value delivery as well as the marketing organization and management. The paper delivers implications for business, especially ideas about implementing AI into marketing, designing innovations and the ideas on how to incorporate new skills into marketing team required by the new technology. © 2019.

ABSTRACT: When using simulation modeling to explore pedagogical phenomena, there are several issues a designer/practitioner should consider. One of the most important decisions has to do with determining how many runs of a simulation to perform in order to be confident in the results produced by the simulation [1]. With a deterministic model, a single simulation run is adequate. This issue becomes more challenging when part of the simulation model is based on stochastic elements. One of the solutions that has been used to address this challenge in other research communities is the use of Monte Carlo simulation [2]. Within the AIED research community, however, this question of how many times should a pedagogical simulation model be run to produce predictions in which the designer can have confidence has received surprisingly little attention. The aim of this paper is to explore this issue using a pedagogical simulation model, SimDoc, designed to explore longer term mentoring issues [3]. In particular, we demonstrate how to run this simulation model over many iterations until the accumulated results of the iteration runs reach a statistically stable level that matches real world performance but also has appropriate variability among the runs. We believe this approach generalizes beyond our simulation environment and could be applied to other pedagogical simulations and would be especially useful for medium and high fidelity simulations where each run may take a long time. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

ABSTRACT: As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly enters K-12 classrooms, what do teachers and students see as the roles of human versus AI instruction, and how might educational AI (AIED) systems best be designed to support these complementary roles? We explore these questions through participatory design and needs validation studies with K-12 teachers and students. Using human-centered design methods rarely employed in AIED research, this work builds on prior findings to contribute: (1) an analysis of teacher and student feedback on 24 design concepts for systems that integrate human and AI instruction; and (2) participatory speed dating (PSD): a new variant of the speed dating design method, involving iterative concept generation and evaluation with multiple stakeholders. Using PSD, we found that teachers desire greater real-time support from AI tutors in identifying when students need human help, in evaluating the impacts of their own help-giving, and in managing student motivation. Meanwhile, students desire better mechanisms to signal help-need during class without losing face to peers, to receive emotional support from human rather than AI tutors, and to have greater agency over how their personal analytics are used. This work provides tools and insights to guide the design of more effective human–AI partnerships for K-12 education. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

ABSTRACT: Recent scandals arising from the use of algorithms for user profiling to further political and marketing gain have popularized the debate over the ethical and legal implications of using such ‘artificial intelligence’ in social media. The need for a legal framework to protect the general public’s data is not new, yet it is not clear whether recent changes in data protection law in Europe, with the introduction of the GDPR, have highlighted the importance of privacy and led to a healthy concern from the general public over online user tracking and use of data. Like search engines, social media and online shopping platforms, intelligent tutoring systems aim to personalize learning and thus also rely on algorithms that automatically profile individual learner traits. A number of studies have been published on user perceptions of trust in robots and computer agents. Unsurprisingly, studies of AI in education have focused on efficacy, so the extent of learner awareness, and acceptance, of tracking and profiling algorithms remains unexplored. This paper discusses the ethical and legal considerations for, and presents a case study examining the general public’s views of, AI in education. A survey was recently taken of attendees at a national science festival event highlighting state-of-the-art AI technologies in education. Whilst most participants (77%) were worried about the use of their data, in learning systems fewer than 8% of adults were ‘not happy’ being tracked, as opposed to nearly two-thirds (63%) of children surveyed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

ABSTRACT: This paper synthesizes recent developments in intelligent textbooks over the last five years and identifies potential research areas of interest to the AIED community. It characterizes traits that make a textbook intelligent. It discusses hot spots in the AIED community such as a) the prediction of academic performance based on students’ reading behaviors, b) the assessment of learner skills based on their reading behaviors, and c) the automatic extraction of concepts taught in textbooks and their interdependencies (e.g., prerequisite, outcome, currency). It highlights key components of adaptivity that lead to full-fledged personalization and advocates the need for intelligent adaptivity as a trade-off between personalized provision of reading/learning materials and development and measurement of self-regulatory traits and grit. It concludes with a proposal to embed observational research methods as part of intelligent e-textbooks to automatically and continually infer causality between reading habits, reading activities, subject-matter competences, and metacognitive competences. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

ABSTRACT: We present a vision for 21st century digital textbooks, reflecting on Carnegie Learning’s experience as a K-12 curriculum and service provider. After briefly considering the purpose of a textbook, we introduce components of Carnegie Learning’s blended mathematics curricula and consider the inherent tension between providing personalized, individual learning while also providing opportunities for collaborative learning. We then describe a vision for an Adaptive Classroom Environment and a supporting Adaptive Learning Recommendation System to deliver improved learning outcomes based on 21st century digital technologies. While Carnegie Learning has proto-typed facets of both the Adaptive Classroom Environment and Adaptive Learning Recommendation System, this area is ripe for exciting contributions and progress from the artificial intelligence in education (AIED) and related communities of researchers, developers, and practitioners. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

ABSTRACT: Among the many disruptions caused by artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies (including automation, cyberwarfare, surveillance, loss of privacy, fake news, infrastructure vulnerability), the effects on development pathways are likely to be significant and complex. AI will enable low-income countries to leapfrog in several sectors, including e-governance, e-finance, e-health, and e-education. Yet AI will also lead to automation, reducing the demand for labor, especially unskilled labor. Labor-intensive sectors such as apparel will provide fewer jobs, and lower export earnings. Development strategies will need to adjust accordingly. © 2019 Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.

ABSTRACT: Baker and Siemens have well explained the theoretical differences and similarities between the educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) communities in their 2012 seminal paper, in which they also wished for bridging the gap between both communities. Moreover, since its creation as an independent conference in 2009, EDM has been evolving in parallel with the intelligent tutoring systems (ITS)/artificial intelligence for education (AIED) community. But what are the actual links that exist between these three communities in terms of members and research topics: To what extent do they overlap and work together? Are they getting closer from each other or drifting apart? Is each community specific to researchers with different backgrounds, modeling and analysis techniques? Those are some of the questions we investigate using a quantitative analysis led between 2007 and 2017 through: A social network analysis of the 3 communities, involving the 1822 scientists who participated in program committees and/or appeared as authors of the associated journals (IJAIED, JEDM and JLA); and a text analysis of abstracts of articles published in these journals. Results reveal the clear differences between these communities, their topics, practices and research methods. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the education sector has largely taken over conventional classrooms and revolutionized the way education is conducted to the admiration of many. Other scholars however, believe that such early celebration of AI benefits is unfounded and inimical to the education sector since the adoption of modern AI teaching systems now raises long-term issues about the relevance of teachers and their classrooms in 21st Century AI education. The Marxian Alienation Theory was adopted for the article. The Ex-post factor method and Derrida’s critical method of analysis was utilized for attaining the objectives of the article. The article faults recent attempts at eulogizing the impact of AI innovations in the education sector and on human development. Extensive research is proposed as necessary for contemporary scholars of AI and education technologist before proper appropriation can be made about its gains in education and on human development.

ABSTRACT: The world is currently enduring the fourth industrial revolution causing disruption on various economic and societal pillars. For Burrus (Brand Q Mag 27, [7]), such change is coming too fast and organizations that will leverage Artificial intelligence (AI) will profit the most. One of the sectors that will get disrupted by the introduction of AI will be higher education. From this point this conceptual paper propose a model for the implementation of AI through expert systems (ES) within the AACSB accreditation programs. ES are knowledge-based computer program that achieves human expertise in a limited domain (Res J Recent Sci 3(1):116–121, [14]). We tried to answer two main questions, whether AI can be implemented through ES and how such systems can reshape the AACSB accreditation process. We concluded that in fact ES will reshape such process while ensuring more reliable and efficient results and reducing time, cost and errors. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Scratch is a visual, block-based programming language, adopted as a computational thinking development tool in elementary education among many countries. Thailand has also recently included Scratch as part of the computing science course in its basic education. However, Thailand is facing a shortage of ICT teachers who are skillful in Scratch programming, especially in small provincial schools. This research aims to overcome the shortage by developing ScratchThAI, a Scratch tutorial chatbot. It is designed to assist young learners directly through a messaging platform. By giving supports through a textual conversation, more relevant advice, knowledge, and resources could be provided precisely. Different levels of each computational thinking concept are extracted and evaluated by the designed assessment algorithm. Extra predefined exercises are assigned based on the analyzed learner’s strengths and weaknesses in order to actively improving the learner’s understanding. Moreover, gamification is incorporated to engage and motivate young learners in computational thinking development. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we propose a new framework for hands-on educational modules to introduce ideas in AI and robotics casually, quickly, and effectively in one package for beginners of all ages in STEAM fields. Today, courses on introductory robotics are found everywhere, from K-12 summer camps to adult continuing education. However, most of them are limited to learning basic skills on sensor-actuator interactions due to their limited time and can rarely introduce what recent exciting AI can do, such as image recognition. As a case study to demonstrate the idea of the framework, an educational module to create a toy car with a camera controlled by Raspberry Pi is introduced. Our approach uses both physical and digital environments. Participants experience running their toy cars on a physical track using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained based on how participants drive cars in a virtual game. The tested idea can be extensible as a framework to many other examples of robotics projects and can make ideas of AI and robotics more accessible to everyone. A proposed AI model is trained to assimilate the participant's game-play style in a VR environment which will be later re-enacted by the physical robot assembled by participants. Through this approach, we intend to demonstrate the AI's ability to personalize things and hope to stimulate participants' curiosity and motivation to learn. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

ABSTRACT: This presentation summarizes results from experiments conducted during an undergraduate research junior seminar class on path finding problems. One major objective was to get students acquainted with Artificial Intelligence issues and introduce tool sets for preparing them to more advanced concepts. In order to foster students 'high-levels of engagement and motivation in this field, path finding problems are introduced in classical problems introduced in basic game environment. Path finding techniques can be introduced in an incremental fashion by scaffolding student's problem-solving processes with visualizing tools for evaluating solutions. Three classical path finding algorithms were tested on ten scenarios. The students are able to quickly grasp basic concepts of optimality, heuristics and admissibility by examining how solutions are built by each algorithm and by comparing the number of nodes explored. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Human behavior models support simulation-based training, experimentation, and mission rehearsal. However, these models are often brittle when used outside of their original development context, resulting in diminished effectiveness of simulation. This paper describes the Scenario Director, a software component developed for an operational simulation system, that enables scenario designers and operators to use pre-existing behavior models in new and different usage contexts than the ones anticipated when the models were developed. The Scenario Director leverages methods and algorithms from intelligent tutoring systems, supervisory control, and computational cognitive modeling. The paper outlines the motivations and requirements for scenario adaptation, overviews the solution, and outlines multiple evaluations of the technology. The Scenario Director is now integrated in a deployed simulation system and is being used to deliver operational training. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: In the United States (U.S.), Blacks have higher morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) than other racial groups. The Black racial group includes African Americans (AAs), African immigrants (AIs), and Afro-Caribbeans (ACs); however, little research examines how social determinants differentially influence CVD risk factors in each ethnic subgroup. We analyzed the 2010–2014 National Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of non-institutionalized civilians. We included 40,838 Blacks: 36,881 AAs, 1660 AIs, and 2297 ACs. Age- and sex-adjusted hypertension prevalence was 37, 22, and 21% in AAs, ACs, and AIs, respectively. Age- and sex-adjusted diabetes prevalence was 12, 10, and 7% in AAs, ACs, and AIs, respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, social determinants of hypertension and diabetes differed by ethnicity. Higher income was associated with lower odds of hypertension in AAs (aOR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.96) and ACs (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.83). In AAs, those with some college education (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92) and college graduates (aOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.53–0.73) had lower odds of hypertension than those with < high school education. In AIs, having health insurance was associated with higher odds of hypertension (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.04–2.42) and diabetes (aOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.29–8.04) diagnoses. We observed that the social determinants associated with hypertension and diabetes differed by ethnicity. Socioeconomic factors of health insurance and income were associated with a disparate prevalence of hypertension by ethnic group. Future research among Blacks should stratify by ethnicity to adequately address the contributors to health disparities. © 2017, W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence technology is an opportunity for education, but it is also a challenge. We do not deny the changes that artificial intelligence technology brings to education. At the same time, we must also consider the problems in artificial intelligence education, such as the fairness and inclusiveness of AI education. Based on these, this paper analyzes the causes of the problems, we found problems can mainly divided into three categories. The irrationality of the algorithm; the incompleteness of the data, and the inaccuracy of the content. Through analysis, we found that the root of problems is in people. So, this paper divide people into three categories according to the different aspects that they are responsible for in artificial intelligence education. Programmers, teachers and students. Finally, this paper gives cautions and solutions based on these three occupations. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The current economic crisis, combined with the sudden increased use of Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in human life presents new challenges and opportunities for engineering education and jobs. Engineering education needs to undergo a revolution; ethical issues that involve AI and the use of technologies need to be inserted in the learning process urgently to guarantee the employment of our future engineers. In this work we identified and evaluated issues and candidate recommendations from initiatives like 'The IEEE Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems' and 'USA NSTC's Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence' in order to provide a set of ethical principles and recommendations that are conversant with Engineering ethics defined by 'Engineering Criteria 2000'. Some of these ethical principles and recommendations are highlighted with the objective of introducing AI in engineering education and improve the connections between technology and society. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have been a topic of great interest for about five decades. Over the years, ITS research has leveraged AI advancements, and has also helped push the boundaries of AI capabilities with grounded usage scenarios. Using ITSs along with classroom instruction to augment traditional teaching is a canonical example of how humans and machines can work together to solve problems that are otherwise overwhelming and non-scalable individually. The experiences of personalized learning created by (1) seamless orchestration of human decision-making at few critical points with (2) scalability of cognitive capabilities using AI systems can drive increased student engagement leading to improved learning outcomes. By considering two particular use-cases of early childhood learning and higher education, we discuss the challenges involved in designing these complex human-centric systems. These systems integrate technologies involving interactivity, dialog, automated question generation, and learning analytics. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Preovulatory estradiol is known to impact embryo quality and survival. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of preovulatory estradiol on the uterine environment and conceptus survival through maternal recognition of pregnancy. Beef cows/heifers were AIed following induced ovulation. Cows were grouped into high and low preovulatory estradiol. Conceptuses were collected on day 16 nonsurgically (Rep 1; n = 20), or following slaughter (Rep 2; n = 29). Blood was collected to determine plasma glucose concentrations, and uterine luminal fluid (ULF) was analyzed for protein, glucose, and interferon tau (IFNT) concentrations. Total cellular RNA was extracted from caruncular (CAR) and intercaruncular (INCAR) endometrial tissue. There was no effect of preovulatory estradiol on conceptus recovery rate (P = 0.38) or on apoptosis rate in the trophectoderm (P = 0.64). Cows in which a conceptus was recovered had greater concentrations of protein in the ULF (P = 0.04). Animals with elevated preovulatory estradiol had greater endometrial abundance of SLC2A1 (P = 0.05) and SLC5A1 (P = 0.04) in both INCAR and CAR tissue. Presence of a conceptus also tended to increase (P = 0.10) abundance of SLC5A1 in INCAR. In CAR tissue, cows with a conceptus had decreased SLC2A4 abundance (P = 0.05). In summary, conceptus recovery rates, apoptosis in the trophectoderm, IFNT, glucose, and protein concentration in ULF did not differ between cows that did or did not have an increase in preovulatory estradiol concentrations. Thus, there is no indication of increased conceptus survival to day 16 of pregnancy based on estradiol concentrations. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: The Energy Detection (ED) represents the most used and the simplest solution for implementing spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio (CR) systems. Previously, an Improved ED (IED) algorithm was proposed, which estimates the average energy over more consecutive sensing slots. We propose an Adaptive threshold IED (AIED) algorithm, which requires some a priori knowledge about the Primary User (PU) signal, such as its average duty cycle and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). We compared the performance of the AIED algorithm with the Adaptive Classical ED (ACED) algorithm for different SNR and duty cycle values. For the same decision error probability, we demonstrate a detection SNR gain of more than 1 dB of AIED over ACED, in the low SNR regime, for high duty cycle values. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Historical accounts of research conducted in American Indian (AI) communities have shown that research activities have not always been in the best interest of tribes. In some instances, research conducted with tribes has been harmful and resulted in unnecessary trauma and distress. In response to past wrongdoings, many researchers now seek to engage tribal communities in research that is collaborative, respectful, and reciprocal. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is one such “epistemological orientation” that has the potential to address the “oppressive, exploitive legacy of research done on Indigenous people.” This article details the author’s experience of engaging in CBPR during their dissertation study of the significance of water and its relationship to AI health and well-being. The author reflects on their firsthand account of developing and implementing the study in partnership with a local tribe. Particular attention is given to the processes of CBPR through an illustrative case example that took place on an AI reservation located in the Midwestern United States. The case example is informed by “counter storytelling” and is critically reviewed using the principle tenants of CBPR. The article concludes with implications for doctoral education and research with AI communities. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: Education through AI has become a consensus in the educational technology community, in which learning performance prediction and classification are two popular tasks for educational data mining. Researchers investigated into different methodologies of machine learning according to their tasks. Often used methodologies are 'Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes Classifier, and Decision Trees'. Our analysis in this paper has shown that Support Vector Machines are less used than Neural Networks in the area of educational data mining. Although Support Vector Machines perform better in some investigations, there is a limited usage of it. We discuss several theses to find reasons for the occurring gap. Therefore, we focus on handling, Neural Networks as a trend topic, data and pre-processing, complexity of modeling, training and prediction speed, and problems of overfitting. Findings show that Support Vector Machines can be used by applying an acceptable effort. Their advantages were discussed regarding the challenges of educational technology. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Interactive learning environments have widely been accepted in enhancing students' learning performance. Students can have interaction with different learning modules, materials, and activities. However, the ongoing learning data is not well utilized for further analysis. Educational data mining has played an increasing role in considering such essential data in order to improve students' ongoing learning and teachers' ongoing instructions. Therefore, this study proposes several model frameworks in analyzing the students' ongoing learning experience by integrating with data mining techniques for interactive learning systems, which can be applied on different learning platforms. Three models have been proposed for updating learning activities to match with ongoing learning performance, for identifying students' learning problems for teachers to adjust the instructions, and for presenting the students' preferred learning materials format. The results of this study can be further implemented by learning system developers to help improve their interactive learning platforms for more significant benefits for students and teachers. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human thought processes and consciousness on computer systems. Experts have gone so far as to chart the future development of AI systems that surpass human intelligence as a single civilization-shifting event, known as the "technological singularity" or "the Singularity." But in the more near future, AI promises to have more concrete applications throughout our everyday lives, including in education, a challenge that China has already taken up. At present, the main applications of this so-called "weak" artificial intelligence in Chinese education are MOOC, web classes, and the flipped class model, with the results already proving outstanding. With the deeper combination of AI and education, we can look forward to benefits like the increasing usefulness of after-school tutoring robots, reliving teachers of burdensome responsibilities, and balancing global education resources. We should, however, also use AI in education reasonably by contextualizing gathered data, strengthening legal protections, and developing moral guidelines in machine programming. Addressing these three points will address the concerns of many laypeople as AI systems are implemented, offering protection for their fragile beginnings in education and encouraging the development of better ones in the future. © 2018 ACM.

ABSTRACT: Global teacher shortage is a serious concern with grave implications for the future of education. This calls for novel ways of addressing teacher roles. The economic benefits of tireless labor inspires the need for teachers who are unlimited by natural human demands, highlighting consideration for the affordances of robotics and Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) as currently obtainable in other areas of human life. This however demands designing robotic personalities that can take on independent teacher roles despite strong opinions that robots will not be able to fully replace humans in the classroom of the future. In this article, we argue for a future classroom with independent robot teachers, highlighting the minimum capabilities required of such personalities in terms of personality, instructional delivery, social interaction, and affect. We describe our project on the design of a robot teacher based on these. Possible directions for future system development and studies are highlighted. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Future physicians will practice medicine in a more complex environment than ever, where skills of interpersonal communication, collaboration and adaptability to change are critical. Applied improvisation (or AI) is an instructional strategy which adapts the concepts of improvisational theater to teach these types of complex skills in other contexts. Unique to AI is its very active teaching approach, adapting theater games to help learners meet curricular objectives. In medical education, AI is particularly helpful when attempting to build students’ comfort with and skills in complex, interpersonal behaviors such as effective listening, person-centeredness, teamwork and communication. This article draws on current evidence and the authors’ experiences to present best practices for incorporating AI into teaching medicine. These practical tips help faculty new to AI get started by establishing goals, choosing appropriate games, understanding effective debriefing, considering evaluation strategies and managing resistance within the context of medical education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Recently, technologies based on neuroscientific insights into brain function and structure have been promoted for application in education. The novel practices and environments produced by these technologies require new forms of ‘biosocial’ analysis to unpack their implications for education, learning and governance. This article provides an original analysis of current ‘brain-based’ R&D by the edu-business Pearson to apply artificial intelligence in education, and by the computing company IBM to develop cognitive systems for learning. These forms of neurocomputation are examined as technologies designed to function according to neuroscientific understandings of the brain, and to impress themselves on the cerebral lives of learners. The brain-based educational technologies proposed by Pearson and IBM are intended to optimize human cognition as a technique of human capital development in order to enhance the performance of education systems to secure a comparative advantage in a globalizing policy space, exemplifying new forms of neurocomputational governance and capital. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: In response to literature documenting the purported disengagement of youth in the civic sphere and the increasing impact of neo-liberal ideologies and policies on the post-secondary education landscape, this article furthers discussion about the civic potential of university education and explores how specific pedagogies can help foster the civic engagement of university students and graduates. Drawing from data collected at Renaissance College (RC), at the University of New Brunswick, this article documents the collaborative and experiential pedagogies used in that programme to support civic learning. Overall, this study demonstrates that the approaches taken at RC are challenging but worthwhile pedagogies that can enhance students’ abilities to become engaged citizens and challenge neo-liberal doctrine at post-secondary institutions. This study also demonstrates how appreciative inquiry (AI) contributes to the development of a methodological framework for studying citizenship education by connecting the epistemological foundations of AI and citizenship education. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

ABSTRACT: The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence's Report of the 2015 Study Panel [1] predicts artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance education at all levels, especially by providing personalization at scale (p.31). Interactive machines are already tutoring students in classrooms. It is predicted that the use of these technologies in our lives, including in classrooms, will drastically increase in over the next fifteen years. This paper presents a pilot study examining the Co-Bot experience of students participating in a robotics competition. The study focuses on child robot interaction (cHRI) in education by looking at students identified as active users of social robots. Data was collected during the World Robot Summit Junior Category, School Robot Challenge Workshop and Trial 2017 held in Tokyo, Japan in August 2017. © 2018 ACM.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To analyze relations among injury, demographic, and environmental factors on function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and life satisfaction in individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Prospective observational registry cohort study. Setting: Specialized acute and rehabilitation SCI centers. Participants: Participants (N=340) from the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR) who were prospectively recruited from 2004 to 2014 were included. The model cohort participants were 79.1% men, with a mean age of 41.6±17.3 years. Of the participants, 34.7% were motor/sensory complete (ASIA Impairment Scale [AIS] grade A). Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Path analysis was used to determine relations among SCI severity (AIS grade and anatomic level [cervical/thoracolumbar]), age at injury, education, number of health conditions, functional independence (FIM motor score), HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [Version 2] Physical Component Score [PCS] and Mental Component Score [MCS]), and life satisfaction (Life Satisfaction-11 [LiSat-11]). Model fit was assessed using recommended published indices. Results: Goodness of fit of the model was supported by all indices, indicating the model results closely matched the RHSCIR data. Higher age, higher severity injuries, cervical injuries, and more health conditions negatively affected FIM motor score, whereas employment had a positive effect. Higher age, less education, more severe injuries (AIS grades A–C), and more health conditions negatively correlated with PCS (worse physical health). More health conditions were negatively correlated with a lower MCS (worse mental health), however were positively associated with reduced function. Being married and having higher function positively affected Lisat-11, but more health conditions had a negative effect. Conclusions: Complex interactions and enduring effects of health conditions after SCI have a negative effect on function, HRQoL, and life satisfaction. Modeling relations among these types of concepts will inform clinicians how to positively effect outcomes after SCI (eg, development of screening tools and protocols for managing individuals with traumatic SCI who have multiple health conditions). © 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

ABSTRACT: Background : Literature on the effectiveness of simulation-based medical education programs for caring for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients is limited.
Objective : To improve coordination and door-to-needle (DTN) time for AIS care, we implemented a stroke simulation training program for neurology residents and nursing staff in a comprehensive stroke center.
Methods : Acute stroke simulation training was implemented for first-year neurology residents in July 2011. Simulations were standardized using trained live actors, who portrayed stroke vignettes in the presence of a board-certified vascular neurologist. A debriefing of each resident's performance followed the training. The hospital stroke registry was also used for retrospective analysis. The study population was defined as all patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for AIS between October 2008 and September 2014.
Results : We identified 448 patients meeting inclusion criteria. Simulation training independently predicted reduction in DTN time by 9.64 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] -15.28 to -4.01, P = .001) after controlling for age, night/day shift, work week versus weekend, and blood pressure at presentation (> 185/110). Systolic blood pressure higher than 185 was associated with a 14.28-minute increase in DTN time (95% CI 3.36-25.19, P = .011). Other covariates were not associated with any significant change in DTN time.
Conclusions : Integration of simulation based-medical education for AIS was associated with a 9.64-minute reduction in DTN time.

ABSTRACT: This chapter examines past research on the development of intelligent tutoring systems and explains samples of a “new breed” of software. It focuses on intelligent tutoring systems attempts to set a tone: Though artificial intelligence (AI) has much to offer, researchers should view its research as applied to education with as much skepticism as they would any other educational research enterprise. The chapter reviews several projects that illustrate the power of AI concepts and methodology for developing systems that present algebraic content in substantially new ways. Most research connecting AI with mathematics education has been to develop intelligent tutoring systems, which are programs that are intended to mimic the behavior of a competent tutor. The chapter explains aspects of several projects, all currently ongoing that illustrate the idea of “direct engagement” between students and computerized, algebraic environments. It describes the nature of the software is probably unfamiliar to a large segment of the mathematics education community. © 1989 by THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS, INC.

DOI: 10.4324/9781315866239-1
ABSTRACT: The articles appearing in this special issue of Educational Psychologist reflect a growing interest by researchers from various fields in examining the use of computers as metacognitive tools for enhancing learning. This topic has become increasingly important as computer-based learning environments become ubiquitous and students use them extensively both in and out of school to learn about conceptually rich domains. It is argued that the effectiveness of these environments will only be achieved if learners regulate their learning—that is, if they deploy the metacognitive and self-regulatory processes necessary to effectively learn about the relevant topics. Using computer environments to learn about conceptually rich domains involves a set of complex interactions between cognitive, motivational, affective, and social processes (Anderson & Labiere, 1998; Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1989; Derry & Lajoie, 1993; Jonassen & Land, 2000;Jonassen & Reeves, 1996; Lajoie, 2000; Pea, 1985; Shute & Psotka, 1996; Solomon, Perkins, &Globerson, 1991; Wenger, 1987). Current research on learning with computer environments from the fields of cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, education, and artificial intelligence (AI) in education provides evidence that learners of all ages experience certain difficulties when learning about conceptually rich domains such as science, math, and social studies. This research indicates that learning about these domains with computer environments is particularly difficult because it requires students to analyze the learning situation, set meaningful learning goals, determine which strategies to use, assess whether the strategies are effective in meeting the learning goals, and evaluate their emerging understanding of the topic. Learners also need to deploy several metacognitive processes to determine whether they understand what they are learning and to modify their plans, goals, strategies, and effort as necessary, all in response to changing contextual conditions (e.g., their cognitive states, motivational level, and social support). Further, depending on the situation, they may need to reflect on their learning and modify aspects of the learning context. © 2005 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Developed and developing countries have already entered the period which is commonly referred to as "knowledge society" or "information society". In fact, these are the synonyms, because they point two linked circumstances. The first one is that modern science, technological and socio-political knowledge influence on all aspects of everyday life. The second is that in creation and production of all the knowledge the role of AI increases. Software and hardware of universal human intellect and artificial superintellect are being created with highest intensity. There creators dream that their systems can solve tasks on the level of human intellect. That is why the use of such systems in higher education has numerous evident advantages because makes it accessible, universal, capable of transmitting modern scientific knowledge into educational process. Through training of specialists higher education can influence on all the fields of social life. But many researchers see the negative effects of AI systems implementation too, and the most dangerous among them is the replacement of human intellect by artificial. In the extreme case this poses the serious danger for the whole mankind. That is why the accelerative appliance of AI demands further careful investigations. Neither euphoria nor alarmism are admissible in this sphere, especially when it concerns decision-making in educational policy. The implementation of AI systems in higher education requires a particular degree of discretion and precaution. ©(2018) Vysshee Obrazovanie v Rossii. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: American Indian (AI) or Alaska Native (AN) refers to “persons having origins in any of the original peoples of North, South, and Central America, who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment”. Currently, 566 sovereign tribal nations have a formal nation-to-nation relationship with the U.S. government. AIs experience some of the most significant health disparities more than any other race. This is despite the fact that AIs/ANs are the only group of people who are legally guaranteed, through a number of government-to-government treaties, the right to healthcare. Although facing a number of financial, structural, and cognitive challenges, greater numbers of AIs are seeking education as nurses or other healthcare providers through programs offered at Tribal Colleges and Universities. This, coupled with the educational support provided through Indian Health Service, offers a glimmer of hope for improved healthcare on the reservations one person at a time. © 2018 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Digital technologies have already become an internal part of our life. They change the way we are looking for information, how we communicate with each other, even how we behave. This transformation applies to many areas, including education. The main objective of this article is to identify prospective impact of artificial technologies to the study process and to predict possible changes in educational landscape. In presented literature review we considered four categories: customized educational content, innovative teaching methods, technology enhanced assessment, communication between student and lecturer. Having reviewed publications on the subject we present here a possible picture of how the Artificial Intelligence (AI) will reshape education landscape. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Superintelligence is a potential type of future artificial intelligence (AI) that is significantly more intelligent than humans in all major respects. If built, superintelligence could be a transformative event,with potential consequences that aremassively beneficial or catastrophic. Meanwhile, the prospect of superintelligence is the subject of major ongoing debate, which includes a significant amount of misinformation. Superintelligence misinformation is potentially dangerous, ultimately leading bad decisions by the would-be developers of superintelligence and those who influence them. This paper surveys strategies to counter superintelligence misinformation. Two types of strategies are examined: strategies to prevent the spread of superintelligence misinformation and strategies to correct it after it has spread. In general, misinformation can be difficult to correct, suggesting a high value of strategies to prevent it. This paper is the first extended study of superintelligencemisinformation. It draws heavily on the study ofmisinformation in psychology, political science, and related fields, especiallymisinformation about globalwarming. The strategies proposed can be applied to lay public attention to superintelligence, AI education programs, and efforts to build expert consensus. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) education breaks a new ground with the recent approaches to let students understand how people being activated by their thinking rule. In the beginning of systematic instruction of AI, the organization should be lateral and subjacent supported with students and teachers. To construct the Artificial Intelligence mechanical laboratory (AIML) may require a vibrant community of inventive problem solvers due to the underrepresented populations of engineering students in the field of AI, and the applications of different science field for the AIML are also needed. In this paper, we introduce the way to correlate the research and teaching process for the construction of the AIML based on the CDIO teaching philosophy. During the AIML building progress, the construction indicators and design strategies may help the students to improve their learning initiative. Through the joining and support of experimental equipment, students’ academic knowledge can be accelerated and more certain for the direction of applications. The close combination of the experimental teaching and practical ability with CDIO project-based learning are consistently found in good practices of active learning for the engineering education. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Personalization is a well-established topic in education and there have been over 30 years of experience in adaptation and personalization approaches that use artificial intelligence. Bringing together methods, techniques and experiences from these research areas is the motivation of PALE this year at AIED. Its aim is to share and discuss the new trends in current research, with specific focus on how current research on artificial intelligence combined with data science and other disciplines can support designers and developers to improve learning in its different stages. The purpose is to give and share promising ideas on approaches that cater for the increasing amount of information available from immediate (e.g., in terms of wearable devices) to broader contexts in order to provide personalized learning assistance bridging the behavioral and the computational. In particular, this eighth edition of PALE workshop includes 6 papers dealing with detecting reading strategies, providing personalized scaffolding to support student learning of written argumentation, using digital avatars who resemble learners to investigate their impact on learning, evaluating the learning effectiveness of a recommender system, comparing the performance of a proposed eye-gaze feature classification method, and providing instructors with visualized information on sentiment and affective state of their students.

ABSTRACT: Designing, developing, and evaluating interactive and adaptive learning environments requires significant investment of financial and human resources. This is especially the case when evaluating the impact of learning environments aimed at supporting self-directed longer-term learners, environments of increasing interest to AIED as the field moves into lifelong learning where mentorship is key. In this paper we propose the use of simulation to help in both the design and evaluation of such environments. As a case study, we have built a simulated university doctoral program (SimDoc) with simulated doctoral students and supervisors (mentors). To make sure SimDoc replicates observed data from a real-world environment as closely as possible, we informed and calibrated the simulation model with data from an actual doctoral program, as well as drawing on various empirical studies of graduate students and supervisors. Next, we used the calibrated simulation model to explore the effect of varying research group sizes of learners and supervisors’ mentoring workload on students’ completion rates and time-to-completion. Our main goal is to provide insight into how to build simulations of environments that support self-directed longer-term learners through a case study of one such simulation, thus further demonstrating the importance of simulation in AIED. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: We model collaborative problem solving outcomes using data from 37 triads who completed a challenging computer programming task. Participants individually rated their group’s performance, communication, cooperation, and agreeableness after the session, which were aggregated to produce group-level measures of subjective outcomes. We scored teams on objective task outcomes and measured individual students’ learning outcomes with a posttest. Groups with similar personalities performed better on the task and had higher ratings of communication, cooperation, and agreeableness. Importantly, greater deviation in teammates’ perception of group performance and higher ratings of communication, cooperation, and agreeableness negatively predicted individual learning. We discuss findings from the perspective of group work norms and consider applications to intelligent systems that support collaborative problem solving. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: The integration of technology in education is speeding up the reform of the education industry, and the innovative application of AI in education can provide the public with personalized, universal, life-long and quality educational services. It is clear that the field of AI will contribute to grow in terms of power and application areas. It would be a case of social negligence to overlook the potential applications of AI in the field of education and especially in addressing teacher shortages and providing basic education to many neglected populations around the world. This workshop is aimed at sharing the potential of AI to promote educational quality and equity for the benefit of society and all people. Therefore, during the workshop, we do hope to build a bridge of communication, create the learning opportunities of face-to-face communication with international renowned experts, and broaden the scope of AI and education research. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: A key feature of most computer-based games is agency: the capability for students to make their own decisions in how they play. Agency is assumed to lead to engagement and fun, but may or may not be helpful to learning. While the best learners are often good self-regulated learners, many students are not, only benefiting from instructional choices made for them. In the study presented in this paper, involving a total of 158 fifth and sixth grade students, children played a mathematics learning game called Decimal Point, which helps middle-school students learn decimals. One group of students (79) played and learned with a low-agency version of the game, in which they were guided to play all “mini-games” in a prescribed sequence. The other group of students (79) played and learned with a high-agency version of the game, in which they could choose how many and in what order they would play the mini-games. The results show there were no significant differences in learning or enjoyment across the low and high-agency conditions. A key reason for this may be that students across conditions did not substantially vary in the way they played, perhaps due to the indirect control features present in the game. It may also be the case that the young students who participated in this study did not exercise their agency or self-regulated learning. This work is relevant to the AIED community, as it explores how game-based learning can be adapted. In general, once we know which game and learning features lead to the best learning outcomes, as well as the circumstances that maximize those outcomes, we can better design AI-powered, adaptive games for learning. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: When used in K-12 classrooms, intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can be highly effective in helping students learn. However, they might be even more effective if designed to work together with human teachers, to amplify their abilities and leverage their complementary strengths. In the present work, we designed a wearable, real-time teacher awareness tool: mixed-reality smart glasses that tune teachers in to the rich analytics generated by ITSs, alerting them to situations the ITS may be ill-suited to handle. A 3-condition experiment with 286 middle school students, across 18 classrooms and 8 teachers, found that presenting teachers with real-time analytics about student learning, metacognition, and behavior had a positive impact on student learning, compared with both business-as-usual and classroom monitoring support without advanced analytics. Our findings suggest that real-time teacher analytics can help to narrow the gap in learning outcomes across students of varying prior ability. This is the first experimental study showing that real-time teacher analytics can enhance student learning. This research illustrates the promise of AIED systems that integrate human and machine intelligence to support student learning. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: It is still very common that students become disengaged or bored during the learning process by using intelligent educational systems. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in gamification as well as its applications and implications in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education since it provides an alternative to engage and motivate students, and thereby help students to reach flow state during the learning process. The term Gamification originated in the digital media industry, however, such a term only gained widespread acceptance after late 2010. Since then most of the research on gamification in educational systems was about conceptualization, modelling and impact of use. The goal of this workshop is to provide participants the opportunity to: (i) present and discuss the empirical studies of gamification in Intelligent Educational Systems; (ii) discuss and promote innovative initiatives in educational settings with the use of gamification; and iii) motivate and solidify the research on gamification of intelligent educational systems in order to leverage the development of such systems. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: The field of AIED raises far-reaching ethical questions with important implications for students and educators. However, most AIED research, development and deployment has taken place in what is essentially a moral vacuum (for example, what happens if a child is subjected to a biased set of algorithms that impact negatively and incorrectly on their school progress?). Around the world, virtually no research has been undertaken, no guidelines have been provided, no policies have been developed, and no regulations have been enacted to address the specific ethical issues raised by the use of Artificial Intelligence in Education. This workshop, Ethics in AIED: Who Cares?, was a first step towards addressing this critical problem for the field. It was an opportunity for researchers who are exploring ethical issues critical for AIED to share their research, to identify the key ethical issues, and to map out how to address the multiple challenges, towards establishing a basis for meaningful ethical reflection necessary for innovation in the field of AIED. The workshop was in three parts. It began with Ethics in AIED: What’s the problem?, a round-table discussion introduced and led by Professor Beverly Woolf, one of the world’s most accomplished AIED researchers. This was followed by Mapping the Landscape, in which participants each gave ‘lightning’ presentation on ethics in AIED research. The workshop concluded with Addressing the Challenges, a round-table discussion that agreed on a core list of ethical questions/areas of necessary research for the field of AIED, and identified next steps. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose that the artificial intelligence in education (AIED) community lead the charge in leveraging multimodal interfaces, in conjunction with artificial intelligence, to advance learning interfaces and experiences that are more inclusive. Recent years has seen the development of various multimodal technologies for capturing voice, gesture and gaze-based input modalities, as well as various forms of auditory and haptic feedback. These modalities could be powerful tools for developing inclusive learning interfaces. To ground this idea, we present a set of examples for how this work can be transformative in democratizing access to technology, while also democratizing designing and building technology. Additionally, our examples reinforce how designing for inclusive learning can result in improved learning interfaces for the general population. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: The “Assessment and Intervention during Team Tutoring” workshop covers the topic areas of assessment and intervention during team tutoring and collaborative learning in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). The development of team ITSs is a time-intensive and difficult task that includes technological, instructional and design based challenges. The goals of this workshop include providing a forum for researchers working in these up and coming areas to discuss the progress that they have made in team or collaborative tutoring, discuss the approaches that they have taken, and the challenges that they have encountered. After presentations of work in three topic areas: lessons learned from team ITSs, team assessment strategies and approaches, and collaborative learning/problem solving in ITSs, there will be an open discussion to identify commonalities and novelties in the approaches. This workshop is expected to be of interest to those in academia, government, and industry who are developing tutoring experiences for multiple learners. The expected outcomes of the workshop include an identification of team tutoring gaps/challenges in varying learning domains, approaches that have been successful or unsuccessful in meeting those challenges, and determining the next steps in approaches that AIED researchers can use for their own team tutor development. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: A study of methods of evaluation in the field of AI in Education shows great changes in a 15-year period. The percent of papers in two major conferences that include some type of numerical evaluation, whether statistical or not, increased from 6% in ITS 1996 to 94% in ITS 2010. This differs from the pattern in the AAAI conference, which started with a higher baseline but increased more gradually. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: This chapter describes the research from T2 FS-based MoGoTW system to DyNamic DarkForest (DyNaDF) open platform for human and machine co-learning on Go. A human Go player’s performance could be influenced by some factors, such as the on-the-spot environment as well as physical and mental situations of the day. In the first part, we used a sample of games played against machine to estimate the human’s strength (Lee et al. in IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst 23(2):400–420, 2015 [1]). The Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (T2 FSs) with parameters optimized by a genetic algorithm for estimating the rank was presented (Lee et al. in IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst 23(2):400–420, 2015 [1]). The T2 FS-based adaptive linguistic assessment system inferred the human performance and presented the results using the linguistic description (Lee et al. in IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst 23(2):400–420, 2015 [1]). In March 2016, Google DeepMind challenge match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol in Korea was a historic achievement for computer Go development. In Jan. 2017, an advanced version of AlphaGo, Master, won 60 games against some top professional Go players. In May 2017, AlphaGo defeated Ke Jie, the top professional Go player, at the Future of Go Summit in China. In second part, we showed the development of computational intelligence (CI) and its relative strength in comparison with human intelligence for the game of Go (Lee et al. in IEEE Comput Intell Mag 11(3):67–72, 2016 [2]). Additionally, we also presented a robotic prediction agent to infer the winning possibility based on the information generated by DarkForest Go engine and to compute the winning possibility based on the partial game situation inferred by FML assessment engine (Lee et al. in FML-based prediction agent and its application to game of Go, 2017 [3]). Moreover, we chose seven games from 60 games to evaluate the performance (Lee et al. in FML-based prediction agent and its application to game of Go, 2017 [3]). In this chapter, we extract the human domain knowledge from Master’s 60 games for giving the desired output. Then, we combine Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and FML to learn the knowledge base and further infer the game results of Google AlphaGo in May 2017. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible for the application to human and machine co-learning on Go. In the future, powerful computer Go programs such as AlphaGo are expected to be instrumental in promoting Go education and AI real-world applications. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

ABSTRACT: This chapter brings all the previous chapters together as they collectively and incrementally built up a crescendo to reach the highlight, namely injecting e-learning with AI to customise the education process. The proposed model makes us of all the techniques discussed in the previous chapters and endeavours to compatibly bring them together to create an intelligent personal learning environment. The evolution of e-learning was led imposed by the technology but this model proposes to conveniently employ numerous technologies and techniques to directly address specific e-learning issues. The next generation of online education is not dictated by technology but by the academic need to personalise learning together with the efficient automation offered by AI. The first e-learning issue addressed is that of isolation and Chap. 3 undertook this task with the ingenuity of crowdsourcing and the popularity of social networks. The connectivism learning theory has been associated with this phenomenon and this model makes good use of this first factor. Motivation is another e-learning issue that is addressed through the contributions from Chap. 4 as learner profiling and learning portfolios support student to be much more self-determined in their academic endeavour. The third and final issue tackles the issue of impersonality that e-learning is notoriously criticised, and Chap. 5 offers adaptive environments through the combination of a learning portfolio and supportive learning network. A truly intelligent personal learning environment backed and injected by AI techniques is being proposed as a compatible combination of all these technologies to enhance e-learning effectiveness as it leads online education to its future and the next e-learning generation. The rest of this chapter is organised as follows. The section that follows expands further the underlying rationale that led to the proposed model by analysing the contributions from the previous chapters. This is followed by the architectural setup of how these technologies come together within an online system to deliver a functional and intelligent PLE. The next section tackles all the implementation details that take place to accomplish and complete the architectural design presented before. Finally operational and pragmatic details of how the online PLE functions are covered in an effort to show how the AI-injected e-learning system will operate in reality. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

ABSTRACT: The development of novel fluorescent probes for selective detection of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in lysosomes is imperative for elucidating its functions associated with diseases. Nevertheless, the reported fluorescent probes for lysosomal H2S detection usually undergo an aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) phenomenon in the aggregate state and cause the self-quenching of fluorescence due to the "self-absorption" effect with a small Stokes shift, which largely limited their sensing application. To solve this problem, we present the aggregation induced emission dots (AIED) for selective visualization of endogenous H2S in lysosomes via a simple co-precipitation method. It is worth noting that AIED with excellent AIE properties and large Stokes shift (∼150 nm) could effectively prevent the notorious ACQ phenomenon and the self-quenching of fluorescence. In addition, the as-prepared AIED exhibits favorable features including good water dispersibility, high sensitivity (∼43.8 nM), outstanding selectivity toward H2S over other thiols, long-term stability (&gt;15 weeks) and good biocompatibility. Significantly, the resultant AIED with good membrane permeability has been successfully employed to visualize the endogenous H2S in lysosomes in living cells. We expect that AIED can serve as a useful tool to investigate the roles of lysosomal H2S in H2S-associated diseases. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

ABSTRACT: Generating diverse questions for given images is an important task for computational education, entertainment and AI assistants. Different from many conventional prediction techniques is the need for algorithms to generate a diverse set of plausible questions, which we refer to as “creativity”. In this paper we propose a creative algorithm for visual question generation which combines the advantages of variational autoencoders with long short-term memory networks. We demonstrate that our framework is able to generate a large set of varying questions given a single input image. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The Native Community strongly recommends integrating Native language and culture (NLC) into reading instruction to improve outcomes for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students. However, little is known about the extent to which recommended practices are used and what might facilitate their implementation. The National Indian Education Study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education surveys teachers of AI/AN students on their instructional practices. This descriptive study builds on previous analysis of survey data, which identified measurable dimensions of NLC in instruction. We now examine (a) the extent to which teachers implement these dimensions and (b) what teacher, classroom, and schoolwide characteristics facilitate implementation. Outcomes suggest that the recommended practices are rarely implemented, and that AI/AN teachers speaking Native language(s) and teaching in classrooms with high AI/AN enrollment located in schools employing AI/AN teachers and staff implement the recommended practices more often. We discuss implications for teacher education and support. © 2017, © 2017 American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.

ABSTRACT: The effect of training background of persons performing artificial insemination (AI) (herd-owner inseminators (OWNER), AI technicians (AI-T), and fertility consultants (FC)) on pregnancy rate and their ability to detect cows not in oestrus were studied. A total of 1584 re-AI occasions on 754 dairy farms were included. Milk samples for progesterone (P4) analysis in all cases were collected, as were data on the herd, previous breeding attempts, oestrous signs, uterine tone, slipperiness of cervix, and co-operation of the cow. Further breeding attempts and next calving or culling date were sought from registers. The cases were distributed into three categories based on P4 concentrations; <6 nmol/l (no luteal activity, could be in oestrus), 6–10 nmol/l (some luteal activity), and >10 nmol/l (high luteal activity, not in oestrus). Of cows offered for re-AI 7.7% had P4 concentration >10 nmol/l, with no difference between OWNER farms and farms using AI service. OWNERs chose for AI more cows having intermediate P4 than farms using AI service (9.8% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.05). AI-Ts recommended no AI significantly less often than FCs (1.6% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.01). Both groups were equally right: 71% and 68% of cows that were recommended to have no AI had high P4 concentration. Due to courageous and correct rejection of cows with high P4, FCs inseminated proportionally more cows in low P4 and less cows in intermediate P4 than OWNERs (p < 0.05). Of cows finally inseminated, 36.7% became pregnant, with no difference between OWNER farms and farms using AI service. Fertility consultants had higher pregnancy rates than AI-Ts (39.6% vs. 32.6%, p < 0.05). Toneless uterus and sticky cervix at AI significantly correlated with AI occurring at the wrong time (p < 0.001). Behaviour of the cow at AI did not predict P4 concentration. In conclusion, 7.7% of cows offered for re-AI had high P4 concentration. Training of AI personnel increased their ability to detect and reject these cows. © 2017

ABSTRACT: A science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-influenced classroom requires learning activities that provide hands-on experiences with technological tools to encourage problem-solving skills (Brophy et al. in J Eng Educ 97(3):369–387, 2008; Matarić et al. in AAAI spring symposium on robots and robot venues: resources for AI education, pp 99–102, 2007). The study aimed to bring computational thinking, an applicable skill set in computer science, into existing mathematics and programming education in elementary classrooms. An essential component of computational thinking is the ability to think like a computer scientist when confronted with a problem (Grover and Pea in Educ Res 42(1):38–43. doi:10.3102/0013189X12463051, 2013). Computational perspectives (Berland and Wilensky in J Sci Educ Technol 24(5):628–647. doi:10.1007/s10956-015-9552-x, 2015) refer to the frame of reference programmers or computer scientists adopt when approaching a problem. The study examined the effects of taking computational perspectives through various degrees of embodied activities (i.e., full vs. low) on students’ achievement in mathematics and programming. The study employed a 2 (full vs. low embodiment) × 2 (with vs. without computational perspective taking) factorial condition to evaluate four learning conditions from a combination of embodiment and computational perspective-taking practice. The results from this experimental study (N = 66 kindergarten and first graders) suggest that full-embody activities combined with the practice of computational perspective-taking in solving mathematics problem improved mathematics understanding and programming skills as demonstrated in Scrath Jr. among novice young learners. Moreover, the practice of using a computational perspective significantly improved students’ understanding of core programming concepts regardless of the level of embodiment. The article includes recommendations for how to make the computational thinking process more concrete and relevant within the context of a standard curriculum, particularly mathematics. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: The data about high students’ failure rates in introductory programming courses have been alarming many educators, raising a number of important questions regarding prediction aspects. In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students’ academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Different subfields of AI (such as vision, learning, reasoning, and planning) are often studied in isolation, both in individual courses and in the research literature. This promulgates the idea that these different AI capabilities can easily be integrated later, whereas, in practice, developing integrated AI systems remains an open challenge for both research and industry. Interdisciplinary project-driven courses can fill this gap in AI education, providing challenging problems that require the integration of multiple AI methods. This article explores teaching integrated AI through two project-driven courses: A capstone-style graduate course in advanced robotics, and an undergraduate course on computational sustainability and assistive computing. In addition to studying the integration of AI techniques, these courses provide students with practical applications experience and exposure to social issues of AI and computing. My hope is that other instructors find these courses as useful examples for constructing their own project-driven courses to teach integrated AI. © 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

ABSTRACT: A growing body of work on intelligent tutoring systems, affective computing, and artificial intelligence in education is exploring creative, technology-driven approaches to enhance learners’ experience of adaptive, positively-valenced emotions while interacting with advanced learning technologies. Despite this, there has been no published work to date that captures this topic’s breadth. We took up this grand challenge by integrating related empirical studies and existing conceptual work and proposing a theoretically-guided taxonomy for the development and improvement of emotion-aware systems. In particular, multiple strategies system developers may use to help learners experience positive emotions are mapped out, including those that require different amounts and types of information about the user, as well as when this information is required. Examples from the literature are provided to illustrate how different emotion-aware system approaches can be combined to take advantage of different types of data, both prior to and during the learner-system interaction. High-level system features that emotion-aware systems can tailor to learners in order to elicit positive emotions are also described and exemplified. Theoretically, the taxonomy is primarily informed by the control-value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun 2006, 2011) and its assumptions about the relationship between distal and proximal antecedents and the elicitation and regulation of emotion. The taxonomy expands upon a dichotomy of emotion-aware systems proposed by D’Mello and Graesser (2015) and is intended to guide the design of emotion-aware systems that can foster positive emotions during learner-system interactions through the use of varied approaches, data sources, and design features. © 2016, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes an interactive museum exhibit featuring an avatar of Alan Turing that informs museum visitors about artificial intelligence and Turing’s seminal Turing Test for machine intelligence. The objective of the exhibit is to engage and motivate visiting children in the hope of sparking an interest in them about computer science and artificial intelligence, and cause them to consider pursuing future studies and/or careers in these fields. The exhibit interacts with the visitors, allowing them to participate in a simplified version of Turing’s test that is brief and informal to suit the limitations of a five-minute exhibit. In this exhibit, the visitor (targeted towards middle school age children) invokes an avatar of his/her own choice, and acts to endow it with human-like qualities (voice, brain, eyesight and hearing). Then, the visitor engages the avatar in a (brief) question-and-answer session to determine whether the visitor thinks that he/she is interacting with a real human on a video conference or with an avatar. We consider this interaction to be an extension of the original Turing Test because, unlike Turing’s original that used text via a teletype, this version features a graphical embodiment of an agent with which one can converse in spoken natural language. This extension serves to make passing the Turing Test more difficult, as now the avatar must not only communicate like a human, but also look, sound and act the part. It also makes the exhibit visual, dynamic and interesting to the visitors. Evaluations were performed with museum visitors, both in backrooms with prototypes as well as on the museum floor with the final version. The formative and summative evaluations performed indicated overall success in engaging the museum visitors and increasing their interest in computer science. More specifically, the formative testing, mostly done in quiet back rooms with selected test subjects, indicated that on the important questions about enjoyment of exhibit and increased interest in computer science by the test subjects, their self-reported Likert scale responses (1 being negative and 5 being positive) increased from 3.16 in the first evaluation to 4.38 in the third one for increased interest in CS. Likewise for the question about exhibit enjoyment (from 3.92 to 4.56). The summative evaluation, done through unobtrusive observation of exhibit use on museum floor, indicated that almost 74% of the parties that initiated the exhibit were either highly or moderately engaged by the exhibit. However, there was one major negative finding, namely the overly long duration of the exhibit, which may have caused premature abandonment of the exhibit in several cases during the summative evaluation. These tests and their results are presented and discussed in detail in this paper. The exhibit has been on permanent display at the Orlando (FL) Science Center since June 2014 and has received a strongly positive response from visitors since that time. © 2017, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Question generation is an emerging research area of artificial intelligence in education. Question authoring tools are important in educational technologies, e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, as well as in dialogue systems. Approaches to generate factual questions, i.e., questions that have concrete answers, mainly make use of the syntactical and semantic information in a declarative sentence, which is then transformed into questions. Recently, some research has been conducted to investigate Chinese factual question generation with some limited success. Reported performance is poor due to unavoidable errors (e.g., sentence parsing, name entity recognition, and rule-based question transformation errors) and the complexity of long Chinese sentences. This article introduces a novel Chinese question generation system based on three stages, sentence simplification, question generation and ranking, to address the challenge of automatically generating factual questions in Chinese. The proposed approach and system have been evaluated on sentences from the New Practical Chinese Reader corpus. Experimental results show that ranking improves more than 20 percentage of questions rated as acceptable by annotators, from 65 percent of all questions to 87 percent of the top ranked 25 percent questions. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: By 1914 France possessed the largest Empire in African history. Yet that Empire was of only trivial interest to both French people and their governments. As the diminutive colonialist movement complained: Teducation coloniale des Fran£ais demeure entierement a faire.1 Though few Frenchmen suspected it in August 1914, however, World War I was to mark a turning point in their relations with Africa in four ways. T he W ar brought with it the final phase of French colonial expansion; it led to the recruitm ent of French Africas first great conscript army; it launched the first concerted campaign for the wise en valeur of the Em pire; and, at least at the mom ent of victory, it seemed to have begun T education coloniale des Fran£ais\T he great territorial question raised in Africa by the war was the disposal of the Germ an Empire. British war aims in German Africa were discussed by both the cabinet and several cabinet committees. In France the cabinet seems never to have discussed African war aims at all.2 T he official mind of French imperialism, non-existent at the cabinet level, was weak and fragmented even at the ministerial level. T he colonial ministry did not administer all French Africa. Algeria came under the ministry of the interior; the M oroccan and Tunisian protectorates were the responsibility of the quai d Orsay. U ntil almost the end of the war, no governm ent departm ent developed war aims for Africa as a whole. For most of the war the foreign m inistrys African war aims were limited to strengthening the French hold on M orocco; bu t in its order of priorities N orth Africa came clearly behind the M iddle East and far behind the Rhine. Only for the colonial ministry was Africa a major priority. T he colonial ministry, however, still remained-along w ith the ministry of public works-lacendrillon des m in is te rs , at the bottom of the ministerial pecking order. By the outbreak of war the ministry, with its fiercely independent yet overlapping departments {services), staffed in general by fonctionnaires of only modest abilities, had become a byword for confusion. T he report of the Chamber of Deputies budget commission in 1917 sum m ed up many earlier criticisms of the ministry:Chaque service, constitu te comme une fo rteresse, traite, pour les colonies quil administre, ses affaires a un point de vue particulier. II advient ainsi le plus souvent… que trois ou quatre services soccupent simultanement, e t en leur donnant pa rfo is des solutions differentes, du reglement dune question de principe qui appellerait une direction unique.3. © Michael Neiberg 2005.

Tutorial: Why data standards are critical for EDM and AIED
(2017) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Educational Data Mining, EDM 2017, pp. 416-417.

ABSTRACT: As EDM and AIED innovations proliferate, the ability for diverse products to consistently interpret each other’s data will emerge as a critical issue. Formal data interoperability standards that enable diverse datasets to be curated, accessed, merged/compared and fruitfully analyzed will play a crucial role in research and in the successful mass adoption of products based on that research, as will standards that enable systems to produce data that can be mined by existing and yet-to-be-invented algorithms. Yet this important topic is often neglected by researchers and system developers, who naturally focus on the specific problems they set out to solve and do not consider how they can either contribute or consume data produced by other systems or how their innovations will fit into larger ecosystems. This tutorial is intended to: • Raise awareness of the role of standards and their criticality for EDM and AIED; • Provide participants with an understanding of the nature, status, and current activity of multiple international standards development effort relevant to educational data; • Provide participants with insight into how they can beneficially apply standards and, in some cases, contribute to their development. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

ABSTRACT: Analyses of text corpora over time can reveal trends in beliefs, interest, and sentiment about a topic. We focus on views expressed about artificial intelligence (AI) in the New York Times over a 30-year period. General interest, awareness, and discussion about AI has waxed and waned since the field was founded in 1956. We present a set of measures that captures levels of engagement, measures of pessimism and optimism, the prevalence of specific hopes and concerns, and topics that are linked to discussions about AI over decades. We find that discussion of AI has increased sharply since 2009, and that these discussions have been consistently more optimistic than pessimistic. However, when we examine specific concerns, we find that worries of loss of control of AI, ethical concerns for AI, and the negative impact of AI on work have grown in recent years. We also find that hopes for AI in healthcare and education have increased over time. Copyright © 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A grand challenge for artificial intelligence in education is building the Intelligent Problem Solver (IPS) for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) Education. The IPS system has to be able to solve the exercises of the course automatically. It has the following criteria: the knowledge base is sufficient, the program can solve the common exercises in the curriculum of the course based on the knowledge base, the solutions are readable, pedagogical and suitable for the learner's level. Discrete Mathematics is an important course for the undergrad technological curriculum at the university. In this course, knowledge about logic and Boolean algebra is the foundation of logical thinking, it helps students improve their skills in logical reasoning, solving the problems. There are many programs for solving problems in propositional logic and first-order logic; nevertheless, they cannot meet the requirements of a learning support system. In this paper, an IPS system in knowledge domain about logic and Boolean algebra has been proposed. This system satisfies the criteria of the STEM education. It helps students to understand the methods for solving basic and advanced problems: simplify the logical expression in propositional logic, reasoning checking, determine the value or the negative expression of of a logical expression in predicate logic, find the minimization expression of a Boolean function with parameter and non-parameter. In this system, the knowledge base about propositional logic, predicate logic and Boolean algebra at the university for undergraduates has been built based on knowledge model of operators. Via this knowledge base, the inference engine has been designed to solve the kinds of general problems in this knowledge domain. The program has been also tested by the students in University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: As AIED systems with agents and avatars are used by students in different world regions, we expect students to prefer ones that look like them according to the Similarity Attraction Hypothesis. We investigate this effect via a system with a customizable avatar deployed in 2 US regions and 2 Philippines regions. We find that US students do customize as expected, while students in the Philippines tend to select names and hairstyles from outside their culture. These results show the need for more nuanced system design to tailor options for regional-level preferences. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: The role of affect in learning has received increasing attention from AIED researchers seeking to understand how emotion and cognition interact in learning contexts. The dynamics of affect over time have been explored in a variety of research environments, allowing researchers to determine the extent to which common patterns are captured by hypothesized models. This paper present an analysis of affect dynamics among learners using vMedic, which teaches combat medicine protocols as part of the military training at West Point, the United States Military Academy. In doing so, we seek both to broaden the variety of learning contexts being explored in order better understand differences in these patterns and to test the theoretical predictions on the development of affect over time. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: With a teachable agent system and a set of linguistically diverse comparison prototypes, we explore questions of proficiency with and preference for local language agents in two sites in the Philippines. We found that students in a higher-performing school produce more English-language math explanations at a faster rate than students in a lower-performing school, who were more proficient in their local language. However, these students preferred the English-language agent, while students in the higher-performing school had equal preference for agents who communicates in the local language. These findings demonstrate the complex interactions between language and engagement in AIED systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: A focus in recent AIED research is to create adaptive support for learners in inquiry learning environments. However, only few examples of such support have been demonstrated. Our work focuses on Invention activities, inquiry activities in which students generate representations that explain data presented as contrasting cases. To help teachers implement these activities in their classrooms, we have created and pilot-tested a dedicated adaptive computer coach (the Invention Coach) and are currently evaluating it in a classroom study. The Coach’s pedagogical strategy balances structuring and problematizing, unlike many ITSs, which favor structuring. The Coach is implemented in CTAT as a model-tracing tutor, with a rule-based model that captures its pedagogical coaching strategy, designed in part based on data from human tutors. We describe the Invention Coach and its pedagogical model. We present evidence from our pilot tests that illustrate the tutor’s versatility and provide preliminary evidence of its effectiveness. The contributions of the work are: identifying an adaptive coaching strategy for Invention tasks that balances structuring and problematizing, and an automated coach for a successful instructional method (Invention) for which few tutors have been built. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Many studies of the mining of big learning data focus on user access patterns and video-viewing behaviors, while less attention is paid to the active video-viewing time. This paper pinpoints this completely different analysis unit, models the extent to which factors influence it and further predicts when a user permanently leaves a course. The goal is to provide new insights and tutorials regarding data analytics and feature subspace construction to learning analysts, researchers of artificial intelligence in education and data mining communities. To this end, we collect video-viewing data from a large-scale e-learning system and use the Cox proportional hazard function to model the leaving time. The models mainly include the interactions between variables, non-linearity assumption and age segmentation. Finally, we use the collected hazard ratios of model covariates as the learning features and predict which users tend to prematurely and permanently leave a course using efficient machine learning algorithms. The results show that, first the modeling can be used as an efficient feature extraction and selection technology for classification problems and that, second the prediction can effectively identify users' leaving time using only a few variables. Our method is efficient and useful for analyzing massive open online courses. © 2013 IEEE.

DOI: 10.4102/sajip.v43i0.1400
ABSTRACT: Orientation: Appreciative Inquiry (AI) has become increasingly popular as a tool for change management in the world of business and is spilling over into a range of contexts, linking a diversity of disciplines. However, instances where management has used AI in consultation with education for collaborative purposes could not be traced as yet. Research purpose: The aim of this study was for two AI practitioners, one in the field of Industrial and Organisational Psychology and one in Education, to partake in a collaborative study proceeding from reflection on the said researchers’ experiences with facilitating AI in different contexts. Motivation for the study: With social constructionism as a core principle underlying AI, it is argued that sharing experiences across disciplines could enrich the literature and the application of AI in different contexts. Research design, approach and method: The research is based on a qualitative, empirical, duo-ethnography using self-reflective narratives of the experiences of facilitating AI in cross-disciplinary contexts. Main findings: Reflecting on experiences in various disciplines lead to the co-construction of new knowledge. Not only were similar experiences supported, validated and extended, thus affirming the strength-based principle of AI, but it also provided the opportunity for disciplinary cross-fertilisation by combining different perspectives regarding the formality of the AI process and the extent of the facilitator’s and participants readiness to work with AI methodology. Practical/managerial implications: The formality of the AI process and hence the extent of the facilitator’s involvement (signalling his or her readiness to participate actively and take the lead in co-creating a new reality) must be tempered by due allowance for the participant’s readiness to work with AI methodology. Furthermore, participants should be accommodated within the psychological space where they find themselves at the moment when the intended intervention is initiated. Contribution/value-add: Duo-ethnography provided the researchers with the opportunity to challenge the ‘other’ to reflect on their own discipline-related AI experiences, in a deeper, more relational and authentic way. The voices and ideas identified and presented counter narratives, also blended in unique ways to augment the definition of AI as a multidisciplinary force to co-create a better society. More specifically, the ‘readiness’ of the facilitator for an AI encounter was conceptualised and applied to the psychological and behavioural readiness of not only the participants, but also the facilitators of AI workshops. © 2017.

ABSTRACT: Patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) require life-long glucocorticoid (GC) replacement treatment and dose adjustment in stress situations to prevent life-threatening adrenal crises. Herein this study we evaluated the patients’ healthcare situation and their knowledge on AI, comparing various aspects to a prior survey in 209 physicians. Using a questionnaire, we conducted a comprehensive survey among 33 AI patients who were treated at the endocrine outpatient clinics of two University Hospitals in Germany. The majority of AI patients (97%) named their treating physician as main source for information. Overall, 89.7% of interviewees were satisfied with their medical treatment; however, about 1/3 reported controversies with healthcare professionals regarding GC replacement in various situation. Two thirds of AI patients increased their substitution dose temporarily within the last 12 months. However, not all patients had an emergency ID, and only 64.5% an emergency kit. None of the interviewed patients identified the need for adjustment in all given situations correctly. Almost 80% of patients did not correctly identify all symptoms of GC over- and under-replacement. Interestingly, we found no significant differences between patients and physicians regarding specific aspects of GC replacement. We showed that: (i) AI patients have some knowledge gaps on modalities and adequacy of GC replacement therapy; (ii) long-term management of patients with AI remains a challenge requiring an experienced specialist; and (iii) further education of physicians as primary source of information is necessary. Additional education may help AI patients to empower them to adequate self-treatment. © The Japan Endocrine Society.

ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) already plays a major role in our daily life (e.g. intelligent household appliances like robotic vacuum cleaners or AI-based applications like Google Maps, Google Now, Siri, Cortana,.). Sound knowledge about AI and the principles of computer science will be of vast importance for future careers in science and engineering. Looking towards the near future, jobs will largely be related to AI. In this context literacy in AI and computer science will become as important as classic literacy (reading/writing). By using an analogy with this process we developed a novel AI education concept aiming at fostering AI literacy. The concept comprises modules for different age groups on different educational levels. Fundamental AI/computer science topics addressed in each module are, amongst others, problem solving by search, sorting, graphs and data structures. We developed, conducted and evaluated four proof-of-concepts modules focusing on kindergarten/primary school as well as middle school, high school and university. Preliminary results of the pilot implementations indicate that the proposed AI education concept aiming at fostering AI literacy works. © 2016 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Van de Laar FA, Van der Wiele E, Stikkelbroeck MML. Adrenal insufficiency: a common rarity. Huisarts Wet 2016;59(11):494-7. Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a rare condition in which the adrenals glands do not produce cortisol (and sometimes aldosterone). It is caused by a disorder of the adrenal gland (primary AI), pituitary gland (secondary AI), or hypothalamus (tertiary AI). While primary Al is very rare, tertiary AI, often due to chronic corticosteroid use, is much more common. Treatment consists of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and aldosterone (fludrocortisone) replacement therapy, management of potential adrenal crises, and coaching and education. Although patients with AI are treated by a specialist, this condition is a good example of a disorder where GPs have an important role in collaborative care, educating and coaching patients, and preventing and managing potential life-threatening adrenal crises. GPs should also be aware that patients with AI are at higher risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and psychosocial problems. © 2016, Bohn Stafleu van Loghum.

ABSTRACT: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) experience significant cancer disparities. To inform future public health efforts, a web-based needs assessment survey collected quantitative and qualitative data from AI/AN community health workers and cancer survivors in the northwestern United States. Content analysis of qualitative responses identified themes to contextualize quantitative results. Seventy-six AI/AN respondents (93% female) described substantial unmet needs for education and resources to assist cancer survivors, including a shortage of patient navigators, support groups, and home health care workers. Fear of negative outcomes, a culturally rooted avoidance of discussing illness, and transportation difficulties were cited as major barriers to participation in cancer education and receipt of health services. Face-to-face contact was overwhelmingly preferred for community education and support, but many respondents were receptive to other communication channels, including e-mail, social media, and webinars. Survey results highlight the importance of culturally sensitive approaches to overcome barriers to cancer screening and education in AI/AN communities. Qualitative analysis revealed a widespread perception among respondents that available financial and human resources were insufficient to support AI/AN cancer patients’ needs. © 2015, © 2015 Society for Public Health Education.

ABSTRACT: American Indian (AI) men experience sexual and reproductive health disparities including sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancy, absent fatherhood, and intimate relationship violence. Using a case-control study within a community-based participatory research framework, we investigated the effectiveness of a sexual and reproductive health peer led education intervention model for AI men, ages 18–24. Intervention results demonstrated the greatest impact on attitudes regarding contraceptives, commitment in relationships, and consistency of condom use. Our study provides insights into how to access education and influence sexual risk behaviors among a diverse group of hard to reach young adult males. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Sharing user information between systems is an area of interest for every field involving personalization. Recommender Systems are more advanced in this aspect than Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and Intelligent Learning Environments (ILEs). A reason for this is that the user models of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Intelligent Learning Environments, i.e. their student models, tend to be more heterogeneous and complex than traditional models used in Recommender Systems. To share and reuse student models we must first understand the restrictions for porting or reusing student models in new ITSs or ILEs. This paper proposes a classification of student models in terms of their portability. Portability is measured via each model’s accessibility, complexity, architecture, popularity, and description. We use this classification to analyse and then grade student models that have been published in the AIED, EDM and ITS research communities in 2013 and 2014. The classification is intended to be used by researchers both as a methodology to measure the portability of a student model and as a guide to find existing reusable models. © 2016, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: The Google DeepMind challenge match in March 2016 was a historic achievement for computer Go development. This article discusses the development of computational intelligence (CI) and its relative strength in comparison with human intelligence for the game of Go. We first summarize the milestones achieved for computer Go from 1998 to 2016. Then, the computer Go programs that have participated in previous IEEE CIS competitions as well as methods and techniques used in Alpha-Go are briefly introduced. Commentaries from three high-level professional Go players on the five AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol games are also included. We conclude that AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol is a huge achievement in artificial intelligence (AI) based largely on CI methods. In the future, powerful computer Go programs such as AlphaGo are expected to be instrumental in promoting Go education and AI real-world applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) remain underrepresented in the academic medicine workforce and little is known about cultivating AI/AN medical students’ interest in academic medicine careers. Five structured focus groups were conducted including 20 medical students and 18 physicians. The discussion guide explored factors influencing AI/AN trainees’ academic medicine career interest and recommended approaches to increase their pursuit of academia. Consensual qualitative research was employed to analyze transcripts. Our research revealed six facilitating factors, nine dissuading factors, and five recommendations towards cultivating AI/AN pursuit of academia. Facilitators included the opportunity to teach, serving as a role model/mentor, enhancing the AI/AN medical education pipeline, opportunities to influence institution, collegiality, and financial stability. Dissuading factors included limited information on academic career paths, politics, lack of credit for teaching and community service, isolation, self-doubt, lower salary, lack of positions in rural areas, lack of focus on clinical care for AI/AN communities, and research obligations. Recommendations included heighten career awareness, recognize the challenges in balancing AI/AN and academic cultures, collaborate with IHS on faculty recruitment strategies, identify concordant role models/mentors, and identify loan forgiveness programs. Similar to other diverse medical students’, raising awareness of academic career opportunities especially regarding teaching and community scholarship, access to concordant role models/mentors, and supportive institutional climates can also foster AI/AN medical students’ pursuit of academia. Unique strategies for AI/AN trainees include learning how to balance AI/AN and academic cultures, collaborating with IHS on faculty recruitment strategies, and increasing faculty opportunities in rural areas. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: This article offers a vision for technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning at scale. It begins with historical work in the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent technology supported and enhanced communities of practice. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: This paper argues that the research field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) can benefit from integrating recent technological advances (e.g.; wearable devices, big data processing, 3D modelling, 3D printing, ambient intelligence) and design methodologies, such as TORMES, when developing systems that address the psychomotor learning domain. In particular, the acquisition of motor skills could benefit from individualized instruction and support just as cognitive skills learning has over the last decades. To this point, procedural learning has been considered since the earliest days of AIED (dating back to the 1980's). However, AIED developments in motor skills learning have lagged significantly behind. As technology has evolved, and supported by the do-it-yourself and quantified-self movements, it is now possible to integrate emerging interactive technologies in order to provide personal awareness and reflection for behavioural change at low cost and with low intrusion. Many activities exist that would benefit from personalizing motor skills learning, such as playing a musical instrument, handwriting, drawing, training for surgery, improving the technique in sports and martial arts, learning sign language, dancing, etc. In this context, my suggestions for AIED research in the coming 25 years focus on addressing challenges regarding 1) modelling the psychomotor interaction, and 2) providing appropriate personalized psychomotor support. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Advanced learning technologies are reaching a new phase of their evolution where they are finally entering mainstream educational contexts, with persistent user bases. However, as AIED scales, it will need to follow recent trends in service-oriented and ubiquitous computing: breaking AIED platforms into distinct services that can be composed for different platforms (web, mobile, etc.) and distributed across multiple systems. This will represent a move from learning platforms to an ecosystem of interacting learning tools. Such tools will enable new opportunities for both user-adaptation and experimentation. Traditional macro-adaptation (problem selection) and step-based adaptation (hints and feedback) will be extended by meta-adaptation (adaptive system selection) and micro-adaptation (event-level optimization). The existence of persistent and widely-used systems will also support new paradigms for experimentation in education, allowing researchers to understand interactions and boundary conditions for learning principles. New central research questions for the field will also need to be answered due to these changes in the AIED landscape. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: The field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has undergone significant developments over the last twenty-five years. As we reflect on our past and shape our future, we ask two main questions: What are our major strengths? And, what new opportunities lay on the horizon? We analyse 47 papers from three years in the history of the Journal of AIED (1994, 2004, and 2014) to identify the foci and typical scenarios that occupy the field of AIED. We use those results to suggest two parallel strands of research that need to take place in order to impact education in the next 25 years: One is an evolutionary process, focusing on current classroom practices, collaborating with teachers, and diversifying technologies and domains. The other is a revolutionary process where we argue for embedding our technologies within students' everyday lives, supporting their cultures, practices, goals, and communities. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: There is an inextricable link between attention and learning, yet AIED systems in 2015 are largely blind to learners' attentional states. We argue that next-generation AIED systems should have the ability to monitor and dynamically (re)direct attention in order to optimize allocation of sparse attentional resources. We present some initial ideas towards achieving this goal, starting with a 2 × 2 (direction of attention × content of thoughts) organizational framework that encapsulates a range of attentional states including overt inattention, covert inattention, zone outs, tune outs, and focused, alternating, and divided attention. We then sketch out a three component attentional computing architecture consisting of: (1) devices to monitor where attention appears to be directed; (2) mechanisms for real-time attentional state diagnosis; and (3) interventions to dynamically (re)direct attention. We describe two closed-loop attention-aware AIED systems to serve as concrete renditions of these ideas. We conclude by arguing that AIED can achieve the dual goals of advancing basic research on the science of learning while simultaneously developing highly-effective AIED systems by "attending to attention." © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Students' relationships with their peers, teachers, and communities influence the ways in which they approach learning activities and the degree to which they benefit from them. Learning technologies, ranging from humanoid robots to text-based prompts on a computer screen, have a similar social influence on students. We envision a future in which AIED systems adaptively create social relationships with their learners in addition to modeling student learning and providing adaptive cognitive support. By deliberate design of the relationships between learners and systems, the systems can have maximal impact on student learning and engagement. This deliberate design would include careful consideration of the type of learning technology and its channels of communication with the learner, the broader context of the interaction, and the history of the relationship between the student and the learning technology. To achieve this vision, as a field, we will need to build understanding of how relationships form in human-technology settings, and how educational technologies should be advanced to support the assessment and monitoring of meaningful relationship factors over time. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: How does AI&EdAIED today compare to 25 years ago? This paper addresses this evolution by identifying six trends. The trends are ongoing and will influence learning technologies going forward. First, the physicality of interactions and the physical space of the learner became genuine components of digital education. The frontier between the digital and the physical has faded out. Similarly, the opposition between individual and social views on cognition has been subsumed by integrated learning scenarios, which means that AIED pays more attention today to social interactions than it did at its outset. Another trend is the processing of learners' behavioural particles, which do not carry very many semantics when considered individually, but are predictive of knowledge states when large data sets are processed with machine learning methods. The development of probabilistic models and the integration of crowdsourcing methods has produced another trend: the design of learning environments has become less deterministic than before. The notion of learning environment evolved from a rather closed box to an open ecosystem in which multiple components are distributed over multiple platforms and where multiple stakeholders interact. Among these stakeholders, it is important to notice that teachers play a more important role than before: they interact not only at the design phase (authoring) but also in the runtime phase (orchestration). These trends are not specific to AIED; they depict the evolution of learning technologies as a whole. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is of critical importance in education where emphasis is placed on the need to equip educators with an ability to independently generate and reflect on evidence of their practices in situ - a process also known as praxis. This paper examines existing research related to teachers' metacognitive skills and, using two exemplar projects, it discusses the utility and relevance of AI methods of knowledge representation and knowledge elicitation as methodologies for supporting EBP. Research related to technology-enhanced communities of practice as a means for teachers to share and compare their knowledge with others is also examined. Suggestions for the key considerations in supporting teachers' metacognition in praxis are made based on the review of literature and discussion of the specific projects, with the aim to highlight potential future research directions for AIEd. A proposal is made that a crucial part of AIEd's future resides in its curating the role of AI as a methodology for supporting teacher training and continuous professional development, especially as relates to their developing metacognitive skills in relation to their practices. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This paper attempts an analysis of some current trends and future developments in computer science, education, and educational technology. Based on these trends, two possible future predictions of AIED are presented in the form of a utopian vision and a dystopian vision. A comparison of these two visions leads to seven challenges that AIED might have to face in the future: intercultural and global dimensions, practical impact, privacy, interaction methods, collaboration at scale, effectiveness in multiple domains, and the role of AIED in educational technology. The paper discusses these challenges and the associated risks and opportunities. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

DOI: 10.1007/s40593-016-0095-y
ABSTRACT: This paper proposes that the field of AIED is now mature enough to break away from being delivered mainly through computers and pads so that it can engage with students in new ways and help teachers to teach more effectively. Mostly, the intelligent systems that AIED has delivered so far have used computers and other devices that were essentially designed for businesses or personal use, and not specifically for education. The future holds the promise of creating technologies designed specifically for learning and teaching by combining the power of AIED with advances in the field of robotics and in the increasing use of sensor devices to monitor our surroundings and actions. The paper assumes that "schools" (i.e.; a place where children will gather to learn) will still exist in some shape or form in 25 years and that teachers will continue to oversee and promote learning among the students. It proposes that there will be educational cobots assisting teachers in the classrooms of tomorrow and provides examples from current work in robotics. It also envisions smart classrooms that make use of sensors to support learning and illustrates how they might be used in new ways if AIED applications are embedded into them. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

DOI: 10.1007/s00520-015-3065-2
ABSTRACT: Purpose: Breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors (AI) often experience side effects of joint pain, stiffness, or achiness (arthralgia). This study presents findings from a qualitative study of survivors on an AI regarding their knowledge of potential joint pain side effects and how both AI side effects and their management through moderate physical activity could be discussed during routine visits with their oncology provider. Methods: Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews were content analyzed for emergent themes. Descriptive statistics summarize sample characteristics. Results: Our sample included 36 survivors, mean age of 67 (range 46–87); 86 % Caucasian and 70 % had education beyond high school. AI experience are as follows: 64 % anastrozole/Arimidex, 48 % letrozole/Femara, and 31 % exemestane/Aromasin. Participants expressed interest in having more information about potential joint pain side effects when the AI was prescribed so they could understand their joint symptoms when they appeared or intensified. They were relieved to learn that their joint symptoms were not unusual or “in their head.” Participants would have been especially motivated to try walking as a way to manage their joint pain if physical activity had been recommended by their oncologist. Conclusions: Breast cancer survivors who are prescribed an AI as part of their adjuvant treatment want ongoing communication with their oncology provider about the potential for joint pain side effects and how these symptoms may be managed through regular physical activity. The prescription of an AI presents a “teachable moment” for oncologists to recommend and encourage their patients to engage in regular physical activity. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Education is one of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of the United Nations. Considerable interest has been displayed in online education at scale, a new arising concept to realize this goal. Yet connecting online education to real jobs is still a challenge. This CHI workshop bridges this gap by bringing together groups and insights from related work at HCOMP, CSCW, and Learning at Scale. The workshop aims at providing opportunities for groups not yet in the focus of online education, exemplified by students who have not have equal access to higher education, compared to typical students in MOOCs. The focus is on theoretical and empirical connections between online education and job opportunities which can reduce the financial gap, by providing students with an income during their studies. The workshop explores the technological analogue of the concept of 'apprenticeship', long established in the European Union, and education research [2]. This allows students to do useful work as an apprentice during their studies. This workshop tackles such questions by bringing together participants from industry (e.g., platforms similar to Upwork, Amazon Mechanical Turk); education, psychology, and MOOCs (e.g., attendees of AERA, EDM, AIED, Learning at Scale); crowdsourcing and collaborative work (e.g., attendees of CHI, CSCW, NIPS, AAAI's HCOMP). © 2016 Authors.

ABSTRACT: The prevailing model for accounting information systems (AIS) courses is decades old and needs to be modernized for cutting-edge technologies and demands for information services. New graduates in accounting require new perspectives and training to enter what is becoming an important subdiscipline in accounting that prepares accountants to serve effectively as data analysts, IT auditors, and participants in systems development. One hurdle preventing the adoption of these roles is a disconnect between AIS education and AIS practice. This article identifies relevant professional competencies and proposes some corresponding actions by the academy to combine accounting, management information systems, and computer technology. © 2016, American Accounting Association.

ABSTRACT: STyLE-OLM (Dimitrova 2003 International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 13, 35-78) presented a framework for interactive open learner modelling which entails the development of the means by which learners can inspect, discuss and alter the learner model that has been jointly constructed by themselves and the system. This paper outlines the STyLE-OLM framework and reflects on the key challenges it addressed: (a) the design of an appropriate communication medium; this was addressed by proposing a structured language using diagrammatic representations of conceptual graphs; (b) the management of the interaction with the learner; this was addressed by designing a framework for interactive open learner modelling dialogue utilising dialogue games; (c) the accommodation of different beliefs about the learner's domain model; this was addressed with a mechanism for maintaining different views about the learner beliefs which adapted belief modal logic operators; and (d) the assessment of any resulting improvements in learner model accuracy and learner reflection; this was addressed in a user study with an instantiation of STyLE-OLM for diagnosing a learner's knowledge of finance concept, as part of a larger project that developed an intelligent system to assist with learning domain terminology in a foreign language. Reviewing follow on work, we refer to projects by the authors' students and colleagues leading to further extension and adoption of STyLE-OLM, as well as relevant approaches in open learner modelling which have cited the STyLE-OLM framework. The paper points at outstanding research challenges and outlines future a research direction to extend interactive open learner modelling towards mentor-like intelligent learning systems. © 2015 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: PHelpS was a system that helped Correctional Service Canada (CSC) workers to find appropriate helpers among their peers when they were encountering problems while interacting with the CSC database. This seemingly simple system had substantial, and surprising, ramifications. Over time it transformed each of our perspectives as to the issues facing AIED. In this paper we reflect on the influence of the PHelpS peer help system on our subsequent research agenda as well as some of the broader influences of our work. In particular, we discuss a number of research projects arising out of PHelpS directly or indirectly, including the I-Help (aka iHelp) system, a peer help system that has been widely deployed in university courses; a distributed multi-agent architecture for peer help systems that uses fragmented learner modelling to support its activities; the active user modelling paradigm which views "learner model" as a computation not a knowledge structure; the ecological approach, a general architecture for learning systems in which patterns mined from learner interactions with learning objects inform pedagogical decisions; investigations, especially into privacy and reputation, arising from the large scale deployment of iHelp supported by evidence mined from iHelp data; and research into novel affective and social motivation techniques. We conclude by discussing the implications of the common perspective that has emerged from these interrelated research projects. This perspective views the goal of learning technology design to be to track learners as they carry out authentic activities, to deeply understand these learners and their learning context, and to provide just in time support for their learning. © 2015 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Johnson et al. (International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 11, 47-78, 2000) introduced and surveyed a new paradigm for interactive learning environments: animated pedagogical agents. The article argued for combining animated interface agent technologies with intelligent learning environments, yielding intelligent systems that can interact with learners in natural, human-like ways to achieve better learning outcomes. We outlined a variety of possible uses for pedagogical agents. But we offered only preliminary evidence that they improve learning, leaving that to future research and development. Twenty years have elapsed since work began on animated pedagogical agents. This article re-examines the concepts and predictions in the 2000 article in the context of the current state of the field. Some of the ideas in the paper have become well established and widely adopted, especially in game-based learning environments. Others are only now being realized, thanks to advances in immersive interfaces and robotics that enable rich face-to-face interaction between learners and agents. Research has confirmed that pedagogical agents can be beneficial, but not equally for all learning problems, applications, and learner populations. Although there is a growing body of research findings about pedagogical agents, many questions remain and much work remains to be done. © 2015 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Our original paper tried to characterize the richness of the teaching repertoire of expert human teachers and to give a sense of how far there still was to go in the development of pedagogic expertise in AIED systems. It considered three ways in which more expert teaching strategies and tactics might be developed. These were via (i) the observation of human expert teachers, (ii) theoretical derivation from learning theories, and (iii) empirical observation of human and simulated students. This paper reflects on the original paper and briefly sketches progress since 2001. © 2015 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: SQL-Tutor is the first constraint-based tutor. The initial conference papers about the system were published in 1998 (Mitrovic 1998a, 1998b, 1998c), with an IJAIED paper published in 1999 (Mitrovic and Ohlsson, International Journal Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10(3-4), 238-256, 1999).

ABSTRACT: Our 1997 article in IJAIED reported on a study that showed that a new algebra curriculum with an embedded intelligent tutoring system (the Algebra Cognitive Tutor) dramatically enhanced high-school students' learning. The main motivation for the study was to demonstrate that intelligent tutors that have cognitive science research embedded in them could have real impact in schools. This study was one of the first large-scale classroom evaluations of the integrated use of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in high schools. A core challenge was figuring out how to embed this new technology into a curriculum and into the existing social context of schools. A key element of the study design was to include multiple kinds of assessments, including standardized test items and items measuring complex problem solving and use of representations. The results were powerful: "On average the 470 students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15 % on standardized tests and 100 % on tests targeting the [course] objectives." We suggested that the study was evidence "that laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings like urban high schools." Since this study, many more classroom studies comparing instruction that includes an ITS against business as usual have been conducted, often showing advantages for the ITS-enhanced curricula. More rigorous randomized field trials are now more commonplace, but the approach of using multiple assessments in large-scale randomized field trials has not caught on. Cognitive task analysis will remain fundamental to the success of ITSs. A key remaining question for ITS is to find out how they can be used most effectively to support open-ended problem solving, either online or offline. Given all the recent excitement around Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is interesting to note that our field of Artificial Intelligence in Education has been making huge, less recognized, progress with impact on millions of students and with the majority of those students finishing the course! © 2015 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We reflect upon a paper we wrote that was published in 1995 (20 years ago). We outline the motivation for the work and situate it in the state of the art at that time. We suggest that a key contribution was to highlight the need to provide support for learners who reason with external representations. The support must be flexible enough to accommodate wide individual differences in representational knowledge. In 1995 we saw AIED systems as potentially having several roles; one key role was to enable the learner to move easily from one external representation (ER) to a different one (switching ERs). Other necessary roles included: to seek to use AI to keep several forms of ER in synchrony as the student works on one of them; to guide the student to one ER form (out of several) most likely to be of use; and to help the student use an ER effectively. We outline where our work seems to have had influence and we review progress in the field since 1995. In our conclusion we identify future research agendas that emerge from recent developments in cognitive science. © 2015 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: The SMILI? (Student Models that Invite the Learner In) Open Learner Model Framework was created to provide a coherent picture of the many and diverse forms of Open Learner Models (OLMs). The aim was for SMILI? to provide researchers with a systematic way to describe, compare and critique OLMs. We expected it to highlight those areas where there had been considerable OLM work, as well as those that had been neglected. However, we observed that SMILI? was not used in these ways. We now reflect on the reasons for this, and conclude that it has actually served a broader role in defining the notion of OLM and informing OLM design. Since the initial SMILI? paper, much has changed in technology-enhanced learning. Notably, learning technology has become far more pervasive, both in formal and lifelong learning. This provides huge, and still growing amounts of learning data. The fields of Learning Analytics (LA), Learning at Scale (L@S), Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Quantified Self (QS) have emerged. This paper argues that there has also been an important shift in the nature and role of learner models even within Artificial Intelligence in Education and Intelligent Tutoring Systems research. In light of these trends, and reflecting on the use of SMILI?, this paper presents a revised and simpler version of SMILI? alongside the original version. In both cases there are additional categories to encompass new trends, which can be applied, omitted or substituted as required. We now offer this as a guide for designers of interfaces for OLMs, learning analytics and related fields, and we highlight the areas where there is need for more research. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: The programming of simulations of real or abstract phenomena is referred to as computational modeling. In the educational sphere, computational modeling is useful for students in learning about a phenomenon via programming activities. Abductive logic programming is a computer modeling activity with considerable educational potential due to the universal nature of logic as formalism for modeling; however, existing languages and frameworks of abductive logic programming require students to have a broad knowledge of logic programming, which prevents the use of these solutions in a general educational context. This work proposes a language referred to as Abd1, which has been designed to facilitate abductive logic programming in school environments. This paper describes the Abd1 language and how it can be used for computational modeling in an educational context. © 2016 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: In our study, we analyze how the smart and open education is developing and what economic effect is has for the employees. As the hard framework of educational environment erodes with the online information diffusion, the ability to learn quickly becomes an important competitive advantage on the labor market. To assess the return on investment in education, we undertaken survey with 504 participants from selected Russian companies and based our analysis on the modified Mincer equation. The results suggest although there was little difference in effect on earnings for purely classic or classic plus smart education levels (about 9.5%), employees who were engaged in open education benefited from notably greater salary increase as duration of their work experience extended. Certain methodological difficulties were due to comparably short terms of open education (hours) compared to classic 1 year which may call for further investigation and extension of the Mincer models. © Medwell Journals, 2016.

ABSTRACT: Examination is one of the common assessment methods to assess the level of knowledge of students. Assessment methods probably have a greater influence on how and what students learn than any other factor. Assessment is used to discriminate not only between different students but also between different levels of thinking. Due to the increasing trends in class sizes and limited resources for teaching, the need arises for exploring other assessment methods. Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) have been highlighted as the main way of coping with the large group teaching, ease of use, testing large number of students on a wide range of course material, in a short time and with low grading costs. MCQs have been criticised for encouraging surface learning and its unfairness. MCQs have a variety of scoring options; the most widely used method is to compute the score by only focusing on the responses that the student made. In this case, the number of correct responses is counted, the number of incorrect answers is counted and a final score is reported as either the number of the correct answers or the number of correct answers minus the number of incorrect answers. The disadvantages of this approach are that other dimensions such as importance and complexity of questions are not considered, and in addition, it cannot discriminate between students with equal total score. In this paper, a method to automatically evaluate MCQs considering importance and complexity of each question and providing a fairer way to discriminating between students with equal total scores is presented.

DOI: 10.3168/jds.2015-10083
ABSTRACT: The specific objective of this study was to determine if increasing the interval between the Presynch and Ovsynch portion of the Presynch-Ovsynch protocol (Presynch: PGF2α-14 d-PGF2α and Ovsynch: GnRH-7 d-PGF2α-56 h-GnRH-16-20 h-timed artificial insemination) from 12 to 14 d would reduce the fertility of lactating dairy cows not detected in estrus after Presynch that receive timed artificial insemination (TAI). Cows from 4 commercial dairy farms (n=3,165) were blocked by parity (primiparous vs. multiparous) and randomly assigned to a 12 (PSOv14-12; n=1,566) or 14 d (PSOv14-14; n=1,599) interval between the second PGF2α (PGF) injection of Presynch (P2) and the beginning of Ovsynch. Cows detected in estrus any time between P2 and the day of the TAI were inseminated (AIED group). From a subgroup of cows (177 and 150 in PSOv14-12 and PSOv14-14, respectively), ovarian parameters and ovulation were evaluated through determination of concentrations of progesterone (P4) in blood and transrectal ultrasonography at the time of the first GnRH (GnRH1) and the PGF injection of Ovsynch. Overall, 52.8% (n=1,671) of the cows were AIED, whereas 47.2% (n=1,494) received TAI. For cows that received TAI, pregnancies per artificial insemination 39 d after artificial insemination were similar for PSOv14-12 (36.3%) and PSOv14-14 (36.0%) but were greater for primiparous (41.5%) than multiparous cows (33.6%). Pregnancy loss from 39 to 105 d after artificial insemination was similar for PSOv14-12 (4.8%) and PSOv14-14 (8.6%), for primiparous (6.4%) and multiparous cows (7.0%), but a tendency for a treatment by parity interaction was observed. Both treatments had a similar proportion of cows with a follicle ≥10mm and similar follicle size at GnRH1; however, the ovulatory response to GnRH was greater for PSOv14-12 (62.2%) than PSOv14-14 (46.4%). A greater proportion of cows with a functional corpus luteum (75.3 vs. 65.6%) and greater concentrations of P4 (3.9 vs. 3.3 ng/mL) at GnRH1 in PSOv14-14 than PSOv14-12 may have compensated for the reduction in fertility expected due to reduced ovulatory response to GnRH1. We concluded that extending the interval from Presynch to Ovsynch from 12 to 14 reduced ovulatory response to GnRH1 but did not reduce the fertility of cows that received TAI when cows were inseminated in estrus after presynchronization. Thus, farms that combine AIED and TAI during the Presynch-Ovsynch protocol may use a 14-d interval between Presynch and Ovsynch to simplify their management without reducing fertility of cows receiving TAI. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of game AI education is not only to help people understand the theory but also to help them to effectively use the techniques in game development. However, it is difficult to comprehend AI techniques by simply hearing a lecture about game AI. SQUARE ENIX AI Academy is a five session seminar series with lectures and workshops that was held by the SQUARE ENIX Advanced Technology Division in the summer and autumn of 2014. The workshops were held after a lecture to give attendees the opportunity to experience the use of the techniques as introduced in the lecture segment. For the first and third seminars a board game workshop was held. For the second seminar, a hands-on session with an AI software tool was held. Finally, for the fourth seminar, a workshop using blackboards in an agent's internal achitecture and agents' communication was held. In this workshop, several groups of participants engage in a practical example application of the blackboard techniques used in digital game chracter's AI that are introduced in the lecture.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in automatically assessing help seeking, the process of referring to resources outside of oneself to accomplish a task or solve a problem. Research in the United States has shown that specific help-seeking behaviors led to better learning within intelligent tutoring systems. However, intelligent tutors are used differently by students in different countries, raising the question of whether the same help-seeking behaviors are effective and desirable in different cultural settings. To investigate this question, models connecting help-seeking behaviors with learning were generated from datasets from students in three countries - Costa Rica, the Philippines, and the United States, as well as a combined dataset from all three sites. Each model was tested on data from the other countries. This study found that models of effective help seeking transfer to some degree between the United States and Philippines, but not between those countries and Costa Rica. Differences may be explained by variations in classroom practices between the sites; for example, greater collaboration observed in the Costa Rican site indicates that much help seeking occurred outside of the technology. Findings indicate that greater care should be taken when assuming that the models underlying AIED systems generalize across cultures and contexts. © 2014 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: This paper investigates international representations in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research field. Its methodological and theoretical groundings are inspired by Arnett (2008) and Henrich et al. (2010a) who addressed the same issue in psychology, and respectively a) discovered massive imbalances in representation in top-tier psychology journals, and b) clarified risks of this situation. Data on research production collected on 2 top-tiers AIED conferences indicate that relatively similar imbalances exist in AIED. Potential threats and challenges induced by that situation are discussed as well as additionally identified phenomena related to the culture of the AIED community. © 2014 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Human behavior increasingly involves digital online software, where the activities and resources that support (1) learning, (2) work, and (3) collaboration overlap and are placed in far greater proximity than the physical world - often just a browser-tab or window away. What scientific and practical gains in 21st century learning, work, and collaboration can be achieved by integrating and contrasting these three areas' relevant technologies, scientific communities, and industry practitioners? For example: How can software for collaborative work incorporate learning? Which methods are effective for coordinating diverse experts to iteratively improve online educational resources? How can online learning improve the skill set and labor force for crowd work? What kinds of computational frameworks exist to jointly optimize the learning of skills and the use of these skills to achieve practical goals? This workshop tackles such questions by bringing together participants from industry (e.g., platforms similar to oDesk, Amazon Mechanical Turk); education, psychology, and MOOCs (e.g., attendees of AERA, EDM, AIED, Learning at Scale); crowdsourcing and collaborative work (e.g., attendees of CHI, CSCW, NIPS, AAAI's HCOMP).

ABSTRACT: Serious games are beneficial for education in various computer science areas. Numerous works have reported the experiences of using games (not only playing but also development) in teaching and learning. Considering it could be difficult for teachers/students to prepare/develop a game from scratch during one semester, assistant educational materials would be crucial in the corresponding courses. Unfortunately, the literature shows that not many materials from educational game projects are shared. To help different educators identify suitable courseware and help students implement game development, it is worth further investigating and accumulating the educational resources from individual game projects. Following such an idea, this paper proposes a game development project of an object-oriented Sokoban solver, and exposes relevant educational materials. The documented system design can be viewed as a ready-to-use resource for education in object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD), while the Sokoban solver itself may be used as an assignment platform for teaching artificial intelligence (AI). Further documentation, platform, and APIs will be realized and shared in the future to facilitate others' educational activities. Overall, this work is supposed to inspire and encourage other researchers and educators to post available materials of more game projects for the purpose of sharing and reuse. © 2014 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The concept of empathy has multiple meanings. In the present paper we present an experiment in which the relationship between empathy and spatial perspective Berthoz and Jorland (L’Empathie, 2004) acquires a significant role in the process of structural coupling Maturana and Varela (The tree of knowledge: the biological roots of human understanding, 1992) and Damiano (Unità in dialogo. Un nuovo stile per la conoscenza, 2009). The concept of empathy in education is at the basis of the relation between teacher and students and between teaching and learning. Thus the concepts of co-activity Vinatier and Numa-Bocage (Revue française de pédagogie, 158:85–101, 2007) and of structural coupling have analogies with empathy and can provide operational indications. The research question is the following: is it possible to detect the presence of a structural coupling and of empathic processes in a class of students and their teachers through the mediation of a conceptual space created by an automated AI system? The present contribution analyses the use of an AI plug-in developed within the European project I-TUTOR. In the experiment the artefact plays the role of mediator between the teacher and the students and lets their different perspectives be compared. The artefact does not engage in dialogue with the student in a one-to-one relationship, but it is a vertex of the student-artefact-teacher triangle. The artefact, an automated space, fosters a comparison between the perspective of the student and that of the teacher in relation to the dominant teaching object of the course. The paper describes the findings of the experiment run with two groups of students and proposes some changes to be worked into the plug-in to foster further empathic processes. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: New statistical methods allow discovery of causal models purely from observational data in some circumstances. Educational research that does not easily lend itself to experimental investigation can benefit from such discovery, particularly when the process of inquiry potentially affects measurement. Whether controlled or authentic, educational inquiry is sprinkled with hidden variables that only change over the long term, making them challenging and expensive to investigate experimentally. Big data learning analytics offers methods and techniques to observe such changes over longer terms at various levels of granularity. Learning analytics also allows construction of candidate models that expound hidden variables as well as their relationships with other variables of interest in the research. This article discusses the core ideas of causality and modeling of causality in the context of educational research with big data analytics as the underlying data supply mechanism. It provides results from studies that illustrate the need for causal modeling and how learning analytics could enhance the accuracy of causal models. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

ABSTRACT: Learners’ attainment of academic knowledge in postsecondary institutions is predominantly expressed by summative approaches. Instead, recent advances in educational technology have hinted at a means to continuously measure learning attainment in terms of personalized learner competency, capacity, and effectiveness. Similarly, educational technology also offers guidelines to continuously measure instructional attainment in terms of instructional competency, instructional capacity, and instructional effectiveness. While accurate computational models that embody these attainments, educational and instructional, remain a distant and elusive goal, big data learning analytics approaches this goal by continuously observing study experiences and instructional practices at various levels of granularity, and by continually constructing and using models from these observations. This article offers a new perspective on learning and instructional attainments with big data analytics as the underlying framework, discusses approaches to this framework with evidences from the literature, and offers a case study that illustrates the need to pursue research directions arising from this new perspective. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

ABSTRACT: Computational notebooks are documents that serve dual purposes: they serve as an archive format containing code, text, images and equations; but they can also be run like computer programs. This paper explores the use of these new computational notebooks to teach AI and introduces tools that we have developed - ICalico and Calysto - to facilitate that use. Not only do these new tools broaden the languages and contexts available to students exploring notebook-based AI computing, but they offer a new mode of teaching and learning for the AI classroom.

ABSTRACT: Metal nanoclusters (e.g. Pt, Pd, and Au) have been those of the most valuable catalysts that have been used in many catalytic fields of hydrogenation, fuel-cell technologies, and water splitting photo-catalytically, etc. In this mini review, the previous works from our group about the optical, electrical and catalytic properties of metal nanoclusters, such as Pt13, Pd13, and Au13, have been reviewed. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation (AIMD) at a DFT (Density Functional Theory) level has been applied to simulate the catalytic properties. The results show that Pt13 and Pd13 nanocluster present interesting hydrogen reduction and molecular H2 desorption on the surface of the metal nanoclusters. An elementary hydrogen evolution mechanism on the metal nanocluster was established as Hads++Hads+ + 2e- + Mads→[Mads-Hads-Hads]→H2 + M (M metal). On the other hand, an Au nanocluster, which is protected by organic thiolate groups, was investigated by ab initio electron dynamics (AIED) calculation. The comparison between the protected and unprotected Au nanoclusters clarifies the contributions from Au core and organic thiolate ligands to the optical and electronic properties, such as photoexcitation, electron/hole relaxation, and energy dissipation, etc. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

Building an emotional IPA through empirical design with high- school students

ABSTRACT: As suggested by Woolf, one of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) grand challenges in education is "mentors for every learner". Mentors can be implemented as Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) in order to motivate students: "The first way such systems [IPAs] must evolve is to directly address 21st century skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, collaboration, information literacy, and self-direction." AI provides the tools to build computational models of student's skills and scaffold learning. Further, AI methods can act as catalyst in learning environments to provide knowledge about the domain, students, and teaching strategies through integration of cognitive and emotional modelling, knowledge representation, reasoning, natural language question answering, and machine learning methods. In this paper, we describe the design and development of an Intelligent Pedagogical Agent that will guide the students through the use of a Serious Game implemented to teach STEM subjects. The use of IPAs is proposed as a support during the game evolution because they act as learning facilitators and guide the learners in the virtual environment by explaining topics, answering questions, giving feedbacks, helping the learners to collaborate with others, providing personalized learning support. The IPA that we propose in this paper behaves along two paths: Emotional, as the interaction depends on the feelings of the student, and pedagogical, i.e., by giving tips and advices related to the topics and to the tasks assigned. The emotional part of the IPA has been built conducting a study on emotions with high school students. On top of the results coming from the study, it has been built an Android application that uses the IPA as a standalone application to prove the efficacy of the IPA itself.

ABSTRACT: Despite their overwhelming success, present-day Massive Open Online Courses are far removed from the student modelling capacities displayed by earlier Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Being mere content delivery tools, MOOCs typically lack a thorough assessment module as well as tools for personalising the learner's track. When learning music, particularly, these two properties are indispensable. This chapter surveys suggestions made by experts in the field of AI in education today towards the incorporation of ITS tools and techniques into MOOCs. Yet, more traditional student models and tutoring modules are not without shortcomings themselves and the real challenge lies in making active models of both the tutor and the student, which can be used to predict future learning tracks and set the right challenges. Agent-based tutoring systems offer an attractive framework for building such active tutor/student models. The proposed concepts are illustrated in the domain of music composition. A tutoring system has been implemented to teach students the craft of counterpoint, a commonly used strategy for learning polyphonic music composition. It is based on the theory of flow to keep students motivated and optimize learning. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

ABSTRACT: Sharing student models has long been a problem of interest for the AIED community. Current proposals can use student models that use machine learning, but can’t modify them. We propose a multiagent architecture for decoupled student models that enables machine learning components to: train with different data, choose what data is more reliable, and to compensate in case its sources of information are missing. The architecture uses a fragmented user model approach. The expected contributions are the architecture for sharing student models and its implementation, guidelines for decoupling or extracting implemented models from intelligent tutoring systems and intelligent learning environments, and an analysis of the portability of current state of the art student models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

ABSTRACT: Metacognition refers to students’ ability to reflect upon what they know and what they do not know. However, many students often struggle to master this regulatory skill. We have designed and implemented two features to promote metacognition within the game-based system iSTART-2. These two features have been tested and shown to have positive impacts on students’ ability to reflect upon their performance. Future work is being planned to further explore the most effective way to implement these features and the ultimate impact they have on learning outcomes. We are seeking advice and feedback on the methodology and metacognitive feature design that will be included in a series of follow-up studies. The implications of this work for both iSTART-2 and the AIED field are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

ABSTRACT: Advanced learning technologies are reaching a new phase of their evolution where they are finally entering mainstream educational contexts, with persistent user bases. However, as AIED scales, it will need to follow recent trends in service-oriented and ubiquitous computing: breaking AIED platforms into distinct services that can be composed for different platforms (web, mobile, etc.) and distributed across multiple systems. This will represent a move from learning platforms to an ecosystem of interacting learning tools. Such tools will enable new opportunities for both user-adaptation and experimentation. Traditional macro-adaptation (problem selection) and step-based adaptation (hints and feedback) will be extended by meta-adaptation (adaptive system selection) and micro-adaptation (event-level optimization). The existence of persistent and widely-used systems will also support new paradigms for experimentation in education, allowing researchers to understand interactions and boundary conditions for learning principles. New central research questions for the field will also need to be answered due to these changes in the AIED landscape.

ABSTRACT: In this position paper, I reflect upon the question "Should AI stay married to Ed?", specifically referring to how research in AI and Education should cross-fertilize to define AIED as an independent practice, beyond its composite fields. In my view, a mix of approaches, inspired by cognitive science, should serve to formulate characteristic research questions for the AIED community. Such questions may be derived from considering the social context of learning and how it is applied in artificial systems, as exemplified by educational games and ITS with Teachable Agents. I conclude by suggesting two discussion points of emergent interest to AIED research: (1) How can we formulate scientifically based guidelines for the use and evaluation of educational software? (2) Is there anything such as "unique AIED competence" and, if so, what does this imply for the AIED identity?.

ABSTRACT: Evidence based practice (EBP) is of critical importance in Education where, increasingly, emphasis is placed on the need to equip teachers with an ability to independently generate evidence of their best practices in situ. Such contextualised evidence is seen as the key to informing educational practices more generally. One of the key challenges related to EBP lies in the paucity of methods that would allow educational practitioners to generate evidence of their practices at a low-level of detail in a way that is inspectable and reproducible by others. This position paper focuses on the utility and relevance of AI methods of knowledge elicitation and knowledge representation as a means for supporting educational evidence-based practices through action research. AI offers methods whose service extends beyond building of ILEs and into real-world teaching practices, whereby teachers can acquire and apply computational design thinking needed to generate the evidence of interest. This opens a new dimension for AIEd as a field, i.e. one that demonstrates explicitly the continuing pertinence and a maturing reciprocity of the relationship between AI and Education.

Education still needs Artificial Intelligence to support personalized motor skill learning: Aikido as a case study

ABSTRACT: Motor skill learning is hardly considered in current AIED literature. However, there are many learning tasks that require consolidating motor tasks into memory through repetition towards accurate movements, such as learning to write, to draw, to play a musical instrument, to practice a sport technique, to dance, to use sign language or to train for surgery. The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) needs new sap to cope with the challenges in the Educational (ED) domain aimed to support psychomotor learning. This new sap can be provided by novel interactive technologies around the Internet of the Things that deal with Quantified-self wearable devices, 3D modelling, Big Data processing, etc. The paper aims to identify opportunities and challenges for AI + ED that can be discussed during the workshop. Some of the issues raised are illustrated within a case study instantiated in the Aikido practice, a defensive martial art that involves learning skilled movements by training both the body and the mind, and which is not only part of extra-curricular activity in many schools, but has also been reported of value for teaching in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education, in particular, some laws of mechanics.

ABSTRACT: We claim that this marriage has never been closed and exclusive. It started because both AI and Education share the goal of understanding the human process of knowing, and getting to know, i.e. learning. The difference is how the two areas exploit the understanding they aim to develop. AI is more focused on making machines that know and learn like people or better than them. AIED is more interested in supporting people to learn better.

ABSTRACT: This position paper explores the relationship between the historic roots of AIED and the challenges of restricting our vision to EdTech that has AI. It argues that the founders of AIED had a broad vision of the field, primarily driven by the goals of creating advanced technology for personalised learning. They were not wedded to a techno-centric view, demanding use of particular techniques that are now thought of as "AI". The paper argues that we have accepted work with no AI, notably in Open Learner Modelling. We discourage, either directly or just because of our name, work that is true to the AIED founders' vision. In doing so, we miss many exciting and promising ways to create better technology for education.

ABSTRACT: This is a time of opportunity and promise for AIED as a field. The field has had some major successes, and is having an impact with significant numbers of learners. Now that Big Data has arrived in education, opportunities are opening up to generate analytics from that data and use it to personalize learning. There is however potential to have an even greater impact on education, and make greater use of AI technologies. The field should focus on realizing this potential, and not divorce itself from either AI or Ed. Achieving impact will require more effective dialog and collaboration with educators, learners, and people in industry.

ABSTRACT: This paper proposes to define the field currently known as AIED not in terms of the technology used, but in terms of system behavior. Specifically, it is proposed that AIED is the science and engineering of systems that adapt to learners, so as to help bring about effective, efficient, and enjoyable learning experiences. But what, in general, is adaptivity? Intuitively, being adaptive means that the system adjusts the course of instruction in nuanced and effective ways based on learner differences, for example the goals and needs of individual learners and group of learners. It is difficult to state necessary and sufficient conditions for the concept of adaptivity. Instead, I stipulate that a system is more adaptive to the degree that: (a) its design is grounded in a thorough (empirical) understanding of learners in the given task domain, (b) it is appropriately interactive, and (c) it takes into account, in its pedagogical decision making, how individual learners measure up along different psychological dimensions. These factors help in comparing systems in terms of their degree of adaptivity. They imply that the presence of Artificial Intelligence technology is not a defining factor, even if it can be (and often is) instrumental in bringing about adaptivity.

ABSTRACT: This article describes contributions that artificial intelligence (AI) has made and needs to continue to make towards long-term educational goals. The article articulates two challenges in education that require the use of AI: personalizing teaching and learning 21st century skills. This article first describes AI and some of its history and then suggests why AI is invaluable to development of instructional systems. Instructional systems that use AI technology are described, e.g., computational tools that personalize instruction, enhance student experience and supply data for development of novel education theory development. Additionally, some intelligent tutors supply researchers with new opportunities to analyze vast data sets of instructional behavior and learn how students behave.
