ABSTRACT: We are working on a story-telling web tool for primary-school classes. The tool should allow teachers to create or modify short stories, and elaborate temporal reasoning games that stimulate children to reason on the time dimension of stories. In this paper, we review the major theories and tools for qualitative temporal reasoning, studying two facets of time, relevant for such a tool: representation and reasoning.

ABSTRACT: A problem encountered in accounting information systems (AIS) education is that students sometimes do not understand how organizational risks affect firm value. This case presents a privately held restaurant that is currently under acquisition consideration by a publicly traded restaurant group that follows internal control guidance as stipulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) guidelines. The objective of this case is to present students with a causal link among (1) internal control weaknesses of a restaurant, (2) financial statement assertions, and (3) management decisions that can impact firm value. Students must identify and translate control weaknesses into the case's business valuation decision. The case is appropriate for undergraduate and graduate AIS and audit classes.

ABSTRACT: In this paper we consider prior definitions of the terms "ill-defined domain" and "ill-defined problem". We then present alternate definitions that better support research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Education. In our view both problems and domains are ill-defined when essential concepts, relations, or criteria are un- or underspecified, open-textured, or intractable requiring a solver to recharacterize them. This definition focuses on the core structural and pedagogical features that make problems and domains ill-defined while providing a consistent and functional frame of reference for this special issue and for future work in this area. The concept of ill-definedness is an open-textured concept where no single static definition exists. We present the most suitable definition for the present goals of facilitating research in AI and Education, and addressing the pedagogical need to focus learners on addressing this ambiguity. © 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.

Using ontological engineering to organize learning/instructional theories and build a theory-aware authoring system

ABSTRACT: This paper describes the achievements of an innovative eight-year research program first introduced in Mizoguchi and Bourdeau (2000), which was aimed at building a theory-aware authoring system by using ontological engineering. To date, we have proposed OMNIBUS, an ontology that comprehensively covers different learning/instructional theories and paradigms, and SMARTIES, a theory-aware and standards-compliant authoring system to create learning/instructional scenarios based on OMNIBUS. This approach was intended to bridge the gap between theory and practice in scientific and technological development, including learning/instruction support. The goals of this study included the following: that computers would (a) understand a variety of learning/instructional theories based on their organization, (b) utilize such understanding to help authors build learning/instructional scenarios, and (c) make such theoretically sound scenarios interoperable within the framework of technology standards. This paper suggests an ontological engineering solution to achieve these three goals and describes the implementation and feasibility demonstrations of the basic functions of SMARTIES, a solution that supports the design of learning/instructional scenarios based on multiple theories. Although the evaluation is far from complete in terms of practical use, we believe that the results of this study speak to high-level technical challenges of ITS authoring systems and the other areas of AIED, and therefore constitute a substantial contribution. © 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.

ABSTRACT: Using robots as part of any curriculum requires careful management of the significant complexity that physical embodiment introduces. Students need to be made aware of this complexity without being overwhelmed by it, and navigating students through this complexity is the biggest challenge faced by an instructor. Achieving this requires a framework that allows complexity to be introduced in stages, as students' abilities improve. Such a framework should also be flexible enough to provide a range of application environments that can grow with student sophistication, and be able to quickly change between applications. It should be portable and maintainable, and require a minimum of overhead to manage in a classroom. Finally, the framework should provide repeatability and control for evaluating the students' work, as well as for performing research. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of a mixed reality approach to applying robotics to education in order to accomplish these challenges. We introduce a framework for managing mixed reality in the classroom, and discuss our experiences with using this framework for teaching robotics and AI. Copyright © 2009.

ABSTRACT: Computer-based educational systems are becoming increasingly important in all levels and types of education. Intelligent Educational Systems (IESs) are computer-based educational systems encompassing Artificial Intelligence schemes to increase the effectiveness of the learning process. In this paper, we survey patents regarding IESs. As IESs we consider either Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) or Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems (AEHSs) incorporating intelligent techniques. We first present indicative functions implemented in the three basic components of an IES: the domain knowledge, the user (or student) modeling unit and the pedagogical module. Afterwards, we focus on representative patents concerning IESs and present the corresponding work. At the end, we outline current and future developments regarding IESs. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Building computerized mechanisms that will accurately, immediately and continually recognize a learner's affective state and activate an appropriate response based on integrated pedagogical models is becoming one of the main aims of artificial intelligence in education. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the various kinds of evidence could be combined so as to optimize inferences about affective states during an online self-assessment test. A formula-based method has been developed for the prediction of students' mood, and it was tested using data emanated from experiments made with 153 high school students from three different regions of a European country. The same set of data is analyzed developing a neural network method. Furthermore, the formula-based method is used as an input parameter selection module for the neural network method. The results vindicate to a great degree the formula-based method's assumptions about student's mood and indicate that neural networks and conventional algorithmic methods should not be in competition but complement each other for the development of affect recognition systems. Moreover, it becomes apparent that neural networks can provide an alternative for and improvements over tutoring systems' affect recognition methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose and demonstrate an evidence-based scenario design framework for assessment-based computer games. Design/methodology/approach The evidence-based scenario design framework is presented and demonstrated by using BELLA, a new assessment-based gaming environment aimed at supporting student learning of vocabulary and math. BELLA integrates assessment and learning into an interactive gaming system that includes written conversations, math activities, oral and written feedback in both English and Spanish, and a visible psychometric model that is used to adaptively select activities as well as feedback levels. This paper also reports on a usability study carried out in a public middle school in New York City. Findings The evidence-based, scenario design framework proves to be instrumental in helping combine game and assessment requirements. BELLA demonstrates how advances in artificial intelligence in education, cognitive science, educational measurement, and video games can be harnessed and integrated into valid instructional tools for the classroom. Research limitations/implications This paper provides initial evidence of the potential of these kinds of assessment-based gaming tools to enhance teaching and learning. Future work involves exploring student learning effects in randomized controlled studies and comparing the internal assessment models to more traditional assessment instruments. Originality/value BELLA is the first step toward achieving engaging, assessment-based, gaming environments for a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)-related areas with explicit support for English language learners. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the framework and the software system we have built in order to provide metacognitive guidance help in Computer Supported Education. The goal is to assist self-regulation of the learner thanks to a dynamic help system which takes into account in real-time the learner's behavior and his profile. The software system is a multiagent system which captures the learner's behavior, analyse it and define the help. Used currently in the step of conception, the software system will become the learning system by successive learning and enrichment. We present its principles and its operational aspects. The application field of this work is the French certificate "C2i".

ABSTRACT: Purpose:Evidence suggests that physical activity and healthy diets may help to maintain cognitive function, reducing risks of developing Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Using a cross-cultural focus, we describe older adults' awareness about cognitive health, and their ideas about how to inform and motivate others to engage in activities that may maintain brain health.Design and Methods:Nineteen focus groups were conducted in 3 states (California, North Carolina, South Carolina) with 177 adults aged 50 years and older. Six groups were with African Americans (AAs), 4 with Chinese, 3 with Vietnamese, 4 with non-Hispanic Whites, and 2 with American Indians (AIs). A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted.Results:Many participants did not recall reading or hearing about brain health in the media. Participants recommended a multimedia approach to inform others about brain health. Both interpersonal and social/group motivational strategies were suggested. Word of mouth and testimonials were recommended most often by Chinese and Vietnamese. AAs and AIs suggested brain health education at church; AAs, Chinese, and Vietnamese said brain health slogans should be spiritual. Participants' perceived barriers to seeking brain health information included watching too much TV and confusing media information.Implications:Findings on communication strategies for reaching racial/ethnic groups with brain health information will help guide message and intervention development for diverse older adults.

DOI: 10.1093/her/cyn031
ABSTRACT: In order to provide empirical evidence on the role of a web-based avian influenza (AI) education program for mass communication and also ultimately help young children learn and develop healthy behaviors against AI and all types of influenza, an education program with two episodic variations (i.e. fear and humor) has been developed and examined with 183 fifth-grade elementary students. A quasi-experimental design was employed to find potential differential effects on the context-specific risk perception, AI knowledge acquisition, retention and behavior. The study results reveal that the fear appealed AI web-based education program was much more effective than the humor-based program in improving risk perception and educating the students about healthy behaviors (i.e. against influenza infection). However, a significant behavior change or improvement of health practices was not apparent on the post-tests (i.e. 1 month after the treatment) in either episode of the program.

ABSTRACT: Recently, some initiatives to start the so-called semantic web-based educational systems (SWBES) have emerged in the field of artificial intelligence in education (AIED). The main idea is to incorporate semantic web resources to the design of AIED systems aiming to update their architectures to provide more adaptability, robustness and richer learning environments. However, the construction of such systems is highly complex and faces several challenges in terms of software engineering and artificial intelligence aspects. This paper presents a computational model for developing SWBES focusing on the problem of how to make the development easier and more useful for both developers and authors. In order to illustrate the features of the proposed model, a case study is presented. Furthermore, a discussion about the results regarding the computational model construction is available. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: HIV-specific immune responses in acute infection early disease (AIED) may be effective at controlling viral replication and in establishing viral load (VL) set point. However, evidence correlating the function and specificity of these responses with the VL set point is lacking. To address this issue, we screened cells from 59 treatment-naïve HIV infected individuals (33 in AIED and 26 progressors) for responses to the entire HIV proteome using a dual color ELISPOT assay detecting 3 functional lymphocyte populations: single IFN-γ, dual IFN-γ/IL-2 and single IL-2 secreting cells. Responses characterized by dual secreting cells contributed more to the HIV specific response in AIED versus chronic infection. Of responses directed to individual HIV gene products the magnitude and breadth of only Gag p24-specific responses for the 3 functional subsets were associated with lower concurrent or set point VL. Therefore the early appearance of broader and more intense Gag-p24-specific responses may be a determinant of subsequent VL. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The area of animated pedagogical agents is related to the development of applications that aim to improve the human-computer interaction process using software agents represented by characters or human figures. Several projects are being developed in this area, and one of their concerns is the "illusion of life" effect. In order to reach the believability needed for promoting the "illusion of life," it is important that researches be concerned with two main aspects during projects of animated pedagogical agents: The design aspect and the evaluation aspect. In this chapter, we will discuss basic guidelines for animated pedagogical agents design, and an evaluation method based on concepts provided by computer in education (CE), artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction (HCI), in order to help CE and AI researchers (to project and to develop pedagogical agents that can enhance human-agent usability) and HCI researchers and teachers (to evaluate these agents). © 2008, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: OpenNERO is an open source game platform designed for game AI research. The software package combines features commonly available in modern game engines (such as 3D graphics, physics simulation, 3D audio rendering, networked play, and a powerful scripting interface) with an easy to use API and tools for defining machine learning tasks, environments, and agents. Flexibility and ease of use of the system are demonstrated by following the process of creating a machine learning game from scratch. The scalability of the platform is tested through the implementation of the existing NERO machine learning game using the new tools.

ABSTRACT: Tools to make the development of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) easier and more efficient are a relevant topic within the artificial intelligence in education community. This chapter presents a set of tools for constructing multiagent-based ITS, and describes a methodology for guiding the development of ITS. The main goal is to make multiagent-based ITS development more efficient and useful for both developers and authors. This has been done to support development of tutors based on Mathema's environment as a reference model. Basically, in order to create a particular ITS, authors have to consider three main steps concerned with domain, student, and pedagogical models. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results of this case study show that this proposal makes the process of building the considered ITS easier and more efficient. © 2008, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: A challenge in AI education is the creation of interesting term projects. An ideal term project is fun, engaging, and allows students to focus on the interesting parts of a problem, rather than spending several weeks designing infrastructure or coming up to speed on a complex simulation framework. In this paper, we describe our efforts in designing a multi-agent team formation environment using the Repast toolkit, which we used successfully for a course project in an upper-level class on intelligent agents. The infrastructure that we developed resulted in a project that was both enjoyable and pedagogically effective, and that could be completed in only a few weeks. We begin with a description of the initial design and deployment of the project, followed by a discussion of problems we encountered, and the changes we have made for future classroom deployments. We conclude with a description of some open issues with our project and how we will address them. © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Just add wheels: Leveraging commodity laptop hardware for robotics and AI education

ABSTRACT: Along with steady gains in processing power, commodity laptops are increasingly becoming sensor-rich devices. This trend, driven by consumer demand and enabled by improvements in solid-state sensor technology, offers an ideal opportunity to integrate robotics into K-12 and undergraduate education. By adding wheels, motors and a motor control board, a modern laptop can be transformed into a capable robot platform, for relatively little additional cost. We propose designing software and curricula around such platforms, leveraging hardware that many students already have in hand. In this paper, we motivate our laptop-centric approach, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept laptop robot based on an Apple MacBook laptop and an iRobot Create mobile base. The MacBook is equipped with a built-in camera and a three-axis accelerometer unit - we use the camera for monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and the accelerometer for 360 degree collision detection. The paper closes with some suggestions for ways in which to foster more work in this direction. © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

DOI: 10.1055/s-2008-1038945
ABSTRACT: Objective: It is well documented that aromatase inhibitors (AI) are superior to tamoxifen as an adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, compared with tamoxifen, an elevated incidence of arthralgia has been observed during AI treatment. Concerns have been raised that AI-induced arthralgia may dissuade patients from completing their full AI treatment course. Patient education on the possibility of experiencing arthralgia and the effective management of symptoms, if they appear, is important in helping patients adhere to AI treatment schedules and, consequently, in improving breast cancer outcomes. Methods: In this paper, we discuss the potential mechanisms behind AI-induced arthralgia, review the frequency with which arthralgia occurs, and propose an algorithm specifically for the treatment of AI-induced arthralgia. As with joint pain in non-breast cancer patients, a sequential approach to disease management is recommended, involving modifications of the patient's lifestyle in addition to taking a stratified approach to pharmacological intervention with analgesia and anti-inflammatory medication. Conclusion: Knowing that joint symptoms can be managed in most patients may encourage patient-physician communication and treatment compliance. A specific treatment algorithm is proposed that may support doctors and patients when dealing with AI-induced arthralgia. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

ABSTRACT: In design on a new teaching system, the challenging issues are including how the system intelligently supports learners. This paper describes a methodology and a system design on the intelligent instruction support in software engineering education by using the conception of human information reuse. To enhance learners' understands, we design a novel instructional model based on the analogical thinking in AI-aided education. The analogical thinking-based instruction consists of three following concrete teaching methods, (1) Analogy dropping method, (2) Self role-play method, and (3) Anthropomorphic thinking method. Our proposed instruction system teaches learning issues based on them. Questionnaires for learners after instructions give the result of effective education in an actual trial. The contribution of this paper is to provide new education theory, the way of educational practice, and implementation of the system. ©2008 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: It is vital to study the electromagnetic coupling to shielded cable for improving electromagnetic antiinterference ability of secondary equipment in a substation. As a hybrid of method of moment (MoM) and transmission line method, a frequency domain model is put forward to study the near field coupling to shielded cable due to the switching operation in substation. Compared with the results of EMTP, the proposed method has been proven correct. Furthermore, this method overcomes the disadvantage of EMTP, which is only applicable for transient analysis of parallel conductors. As an example, the presented method is applied to evaluating the electromagnetic interference (EMI) to the shielded cable, whose shield is grounded at both ends, due to the switching operation in 500 kV air insulation substation (AIS). © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Since the beginning of the use of technology to support training and learning there has always been the belief that such new technologies would be able to add value either by reducing costs or increasing effectiveness. The 1980s and early 1990s were a period of enormous optimism as to the promise that such technology could bring. The governments of Europe and the US were generous in their funding of research in this area. In Europe research and development programmes such as ESPRIT, DELTA, RACE, ERASMUS and COMETT, to name only a few, funded a wealth of initiatives aimed at advancing the use of technology. At the margins of the early initiatives was the belief that AI must have a part to play in these developments. This paper reviews the early initiatives and suggests reasons why the potential for the use of AI in education and training has never been truly fulfilled. © 2008 Biritish Educational Communications and Technology Agency.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents an ontology-based approach for the dynamic generation of learning knowledge objects (LKO). These objects have the particularity of implementing AIED techniques and they exhibit characteristics hitherto reserved for intelligent tutoring systems (ITS): they are knowledge-based, adapted to a learner model and they are composed dynamically according to a learning need and a particular instructional theory. Additionally, the paper tackles the issue of using eLearning resources by ITS and shows how this could be realized. Finally, the paper also demonstrates how LKOs are deployed and evaluates briefly the results of the proposed approach. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a semiautomatic framework that aims to produce domain concept maps from text and then to derive domain ontologies from these concept maps. This methodology particularly targets the e-learning and Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) communities as they need such structures to sustain the production of e-learning resources tailored to learners' needs. This paper details the steps to transform textual resources, particularly textual learning objects (LOs), into domain concept maps, and it explains how this abstract structure is transformed into a formal domain ontology. A methodology is also presented to evaluate the results of ontology learning. The paper shows how such structures (domain concept maps and formal ontologies) make it possible to bridge the gap between e-learning and Intelligent Tutoring Systems by providing a common domain model. © 2008 IEEE

ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the suitability of iRobots Roomba as a low-cost robotic platform for use in AI research and education. Examining the sensing and actuation capabilities of the vacuum base led us to develop sensor and actuation models more accurate than those provided by the raw API. We validate these models with implementations of Monte Carlo Localization and FastSLAM, algorithms that suggest the Roomba's viability for AI research. Classroom trials incorporated the Roomba into CS 1 and CS 2 courses in the Spring of 2006, and student feedback has been similarly promising for educational uses. While the platform has both benefits and drawbacks relative to similarly-priced alternatives, we conclude that the Roomba will interest many educators, especially those focusing on the computational facets of robotics or applications involving large, homogeneous groups of physical agents.

ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of both great breadth and depth. Thus, determining undergraduate material for an AI course can be problematic. Fortunately, AI is continually searching for new perspectives on problem solving that eventually propagate into the Computer Science mainstream. An approach is proposed for undergraduate AI education that utilizes these aspects of exploration and propagation. The approach introduces important individual techniques early in the computer science curriculum to form a foundation for the upper-level AI course focusing on research methods. This approach is explored using two Sudoku projects at different levels in the Computer Science curriculum, with constraint satisfaction used as the individual technique. Sudoku is a logic puzzle that has a great deal of appeal and is easily encoded as a constraint satisfaction problem domain. In the introductory-level CS 2 course, the Sudoku-based project uses a provided BackTrack class that can be employed to find a path through a maze, place eight queens, or schedule a knight's tour. This illustrates the power of recursion in general and backtracking in particular (a central aspect of constraint satisfaction techniques.) In the upper-level AI course, Sudoku is used as a problem domain for developing a puzzle solver using the full breadth of constraint satisfaction techniques and producing an optimal puzzle generator using a technique of the student's own selection. Students are required to write a research quality publication based on the results of their projects. The goal of the paper is to provide a research experience where not only a solution is derived but the reasoning process is directly explored. Due to the frequency that the AI course is taught, two separate student populations are discussed. The results from the dual population still allow for a viable exploration of this cross-curriculum approach. Finally, the paper illustrates that Sudoku is an excellent problem domain choice for teaching AI approaches in both introductory- and upper-level computer science courses.

ABSTRACT: The Mini Grand Challenge outdoor robot design contest was developed at the Penn State Abington campus to promote advances in robot education and technology. Partly inspired by the DARPA Grand Challenge, ground robots must navigate unmarked pathways on a suburban college campus and reach waypoint goals. Robots must also interact and entertain spectators during travel along the designated route. The contest facilitates and encourages the use of low-cost robot platforms in order to make the experience highly accessible to students and educators. A successful robot platform for less than $300 was developed by Penn State Abington for participation in the 2005 and 2006 contest offerings. The outdoor contest and low-cost platforms provide a challenging but accessible educational opportunity for robotics and AI education at the undergraduate and K-12 levels.

ABSTRACT: To discuss the treatment of compound betamethasone injection in cases with the intractable low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL). Compound betamethasone injection 1 ml had been injected postaural only once to 23 cases with the unilateral LFSNHL, then observe the effect and follow-up at least 6 months. At the same time, the same therapy used to 4 cases with the binaural LFSNHL. The control group gave Merislon and Sibelium peroral for 2 weeks to 18 cases with the unilateral LFSNHL. In unilateral LFSNHL group, twelve cases recovered, 7 cases had the hearing improved and 4 cases were ineffective in 23 cases. The efficiency was 82.6%. 2 cases (2 ears) showed hearing falling at low-frequency after 2-3 months. Others didn't recur after 6 months. 1 case showed low-grade skin atrophy at the local injection part. No other side-effects showed. In 4 binaural cases, 2 cases in effect and the others had no effect, and the former recurred after 1-2 months. In control group, 1 week after the end of therapy, 3 cases (3 ears) recovered, 1 case (1 ear) recovered 2 weeks later after the end of therapy, and the 4 cases didn't recur after 2 months. The other 14 cases were ineffective. Compound betamethasone injection postaural treated intractable LFSNHL effectively, but no obvious efficiency to cases with the binaural LFSNHL. May be these cases have some relationship with autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED).

ABSTRACT: Disparities exist in the numbers of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) in the health professions as compared with the general United States (US) population. Numerous factors contribute to this disparity, including inequities in education, healthcare and economic development opportunities. The basis for inequality is rooted in the policy arena. Issues in health professions education blend the arenas of health policy and education policy. Although AI/ANs have a birth right to healthcare and to education programs as a result of treaties signed between the US and tribal governments, these programs are severely under funded. To understand the disparities in health professions education for AI/ANs today, it is important to understand the history of US federal Indian policy over the last two centuries. Following a history of removal, assimilation, reorganization and termination, the current phase of federal Indian policy is tribal self-determination. As a result, opportunities exist to reduce disparities in the number of AI/AN health professionals and in health disparities. AI/AN tribes have the opportunity to work in partnership to coordinate health, education, social and economic development policy to increase the numbers of AI/AN health professionals. Tribes can also make it a priority to coordinate political advocacy efforts to improve funding for AI/AN health and education programs.

ABSTRACT: Virtual characters simulated by computers have been a subject for research and development in both Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) and video game design. Between AIED and video games there is an emerging enterprise, that is, virtual characters in video learning game design. This paper proposes a Profile-Driven-Interaction (PDI) framework which borrows the design experience of virtual characters from AIED research to that for video learning games. The PDI framework enables virtual characters to take roles for various educational purposes based on the learner model of that learner and learner models of other learners. These virtual characters are designed in such a way that when they interact with a learner, the learner is actually improving her learning status. Based on this framework, a video learning game, called My-Pet-and-Her-Friends, is developed to address some relevant issues in the learning process, in particular, the issues of engagement and reflection of the learner. © 2007 IEEE.

A novel CACNA1F gene mutation causes Åland Island eye disease

DOI: 10.1167/iovs.06-1103
ABSTRACT: PURPOSE. Åland Island eye disease (AIED), also known as Forsius-Eriksson syndrome, is an X-linked recessive retinal disease characterized by a combination of fundus hypopigmentation, decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, astigmatism, protan color vision defect, progressive myopia, and defective dark adaptation. Electroretinography reveals abnormalities in both photopic and scotopic functions. The gene locus for AIED has been mapped to the pericentromeric region of the X-chromosome, but the causative gene is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the mutated gene underlying the disease phenotype in the original AIED-affected family. METHODS. All exons of the CACNA1F gene were studied by DNA sequencing. CACNA1F mRNA from cultured lymphoblasts was analyzed by RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing. RESULTS. A novel deletion covering exon 30 and portions of flanking introns of the CACNA1F gene was identified in patients with AIED. Results from expression studies were consistent with the DNA studies and showed that mRNA lacked exon 30. The identified in-frame deletion mutation is predicted to cause a deletion of a transmembrane segment and an extracellular loop within repeat domain IV, and consequently an altered membrane topology of the encoded α1- subunit of the Cav1.4 calcium channel. CONCLUSIONS. Mutations in CACNA1F are known to cause the incomplete form of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2). Since the clinical picture of AIED is quite similar to CSNB2, it has long been discussed whether these disorders are allelic or form a single entity. The present study clearly indicates that AIED is also caused by a novel CACNA1F gene mutation. Copyright © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

ABSTRACT: Three studies examined models of education among American Indian (AI), Asian American (AA), and European American (EA) students. Cultural models of education are patterns of ideas and practices relevant to schools, teachers, and self that mediate and regulate behavior in the academic domain. In study 1, mainstream university students (N = 148) and AI University students (N = 187) viewed education as a tool for success. AI, however, generated more mentions of education as a tool for community success and more negative associations to education. Study 2 (N = 166) showed that AI, in contrast to EA and AA, placed family and community concerns ahead of academic concerns. In Study 3 (N = 118), AI and AA endorsed independent and interdependent representations of self, while EA endorsed only independent representations. For AI and AA, but not for EA, interdependent representations were positively related to trust for teacher. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

ABSTRACT: We present an approach to designing intelligent tutoring systems, termed the Difficulty Factors Approach. In this approach, the designer investigates, at each iteration of the design cycle, which skills and concepts are difficult for students, and what factors underlie those difficulties. We show that this approach complements existing design principles, producing data that helps designers apply principles in context. We also show that by continuing to investigate student difficulties throughout the design process, it is possible to discover difficulty factors initially obscured by other difficulty factors. We give an example of the application of the Difficulty Factors Approach in the context of the development of a cognitive tutor lesson on scatterplots. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: To establish a database of exports by Australian acute health care institutions for the period in which exports were first promoted. METHOD: Hospital morbidity data for patients resident overseas (Group A) and Medicare ineligible patients resident in Australia (Group B) were sought for the period 1983-84 to 1995-96 from each state and territory health department. Private hospital permission was obtained for the release of identifiable private hospital data. RESULTS: Data were coalesced into a relational database covering the period 1987-88 to 1995-96. Coding variations between and within jurisdictions over time necessitated the development of a consistent coding mechanism. Group A and Group B patients gave rise to at least 77,568 separations over the period 1987-88 to 1995-96. Of these separations 58,418 (75.3%) should have generated export income and another 10,158 separations (13.1%) were likely to have generated export income. Definite export separations not for dialysis number 52,573, and these form the AIED. CONCLUSION: An Australian database of inpatient exports, the AIED, encompassing public and private hospital data has been established for the period 1987-88 to 1995-96. The problems encountered in the course of this study emphasise the desirability of maintaining an adequately resourced national repository for health statistics.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present a (semi) automatic framework that aims to produce a domain concept map (DCM) from text and to derive a domain ontology from this concept map. This methodology targets particularly the educational field because of the need of such structures (Ontologies and CM) within the e-Learning and AIED communities to sustain the production of e-Learning resources tailored to learner's needs. This paper details the steps that transform textual resources (and particularly textual learning objects) into a domain concept map and explains how this abstract structure is transformed into a more formal domain ontology. The paper also shows how these structures make it possible to bridge the gap between e-learning standard learning objects and Intelligent Tutoring Systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

ABSTRACT: Avian influenza (AI) had outbreaks in Thailand from January 2004 to December 2005, which resulted in 22 human cases, and 14 deaths. Three confirmed cases were reported in Suphan Buri Province in 2004, one of whom died. A cross-sectional study aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes, and practices about AI in Song Phi Nong District of Suphan Buri Province. Most of the respondents had moderate levels of knowledge. Most of their attitudes towards and practices of the prevention and control of AI were also appropriate. However, the peoples' knowledge about major signs and symptoms of AI was limited. The study suggested that those who had received information from media had better attitudes towards and practices of AI prevention and control, compared with those who had not received information from media. Therefore, the media played an important role in improving knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; but for the better protection from AI, continuing health education will be necessary in Thailand.

ABSTRACT: A duplex ultrasound system incorporating a pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound probe with conventional B-mode real-time imaging was used to evaluate the biometric and the hemodynamic of abdominal aorta and external iliac arteries of a hundred and thirty one normal dogs. Results of biometrics of abdominal aorta, presented a mean diameter of 0.80cm in its diaphragmatic segment (AOD); 0.74cm in its segment caudal to the renal arteries (AOR) and 0.69cm in the segment cranial to its termination (AOT). The right-external-iliac artery (AIED) presented a mean diameter of 0.42cm and the left-external iliac artery (AIEE) a mean diameter of 0.39cm. The hemodynamic study of the abdominal aorta presented a medium systolic peak velocity to AOR of 104cm per sec.; to AOT of 99.61cm per sec.; to AIED of 85.47cm per sec. and to AIEE of 99.51cm per sec. Correlations of different intensities between the vascular diameters have been verified between the measured points and the corporeal biometric factors (Crown Rump-Lenght). Low correlations have been observed regarding the diameters in relation to the age.

ABSTRACT: Chorale harmonization is one of the most popular problem domains for AI-music researchers. The problem has been approached with various techniques ranging from a knowledge intensive approach on one end to a data intensive approach on the other end. Various approaches offer different strengths and pose different weaknesses. In this report, we explain our knowledge intensive approach. Here, we view chorale harmonization from a search control perspective. In this perspective, the harmonization activities are discretely captured as states. These states form a state space, which cannot be exhaustively examined since it is intractable by nature. To overcome the intractability problem, we propose a careful knowledge engineering approach. The approach offers a useful language specialized for the chorale harmonization task. This language controls the search at the meta-level through its three primitives, namely: rules, tests and measures. The harmonization outputs obtained from this method are very promising. The approach also offers a very promising application in the AI-education area. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

DOI: 10.1109/WMTE.2006.261335
ABSTRACT: The purpose of this talk is twofold. First, we argue, with extension of some of our previous work, that there are three research avenues of wireless, mobile, and ubiquitous technology enhanced learning, namely, dream-based research, adoption-based research, and humanity-based research. They are one after the other in time and overlapping in content. Humanity-based research strives for a long term research goal for supporting human learning with the primary concern on individuality, personal developmental potential, and the like, whether the student learns individually or socially. Second, we argue that in order to proceed to humanity-based research, we need to harness and revisit research on student modeling which is the central theme of the current artificial intelligence in education research. In particular, profile enhanced classroom learning (PECL) in a one-to-one classroom, a classroom where every student learns with at least a wireless enabled handy computing device, is an important step towards the humanity-based research avenue. Furthermore, PECL broadens the scopes of both artificial intelligence in education and computer supported collaborative learning and serves as a platform for the design and investigation of game-based learning in classroom settings. We shall illustrate some sample prototypes of PECL in this talk. © 2006 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Introduction. The Authors present their epidemiological and clinical observations from a poll that has been made to improve the visibility of stalking in the city of Genoa. Materials and Methods. Data have been obtained with a questionnaire that has been distributed to the population by the Clinica Psichiatrica of San Martino Hospital and AIED (Associazione Italiana per l'Educazione Demografica). The Authors have analysed victims' charactheristics (age, sex, education, job, marital status) and troubles' characteristics (duration, kind, dangerousness) and they have compared the data with the international literature. Discussion. They have also analysed the level of acquaintance between stalker and victim and the possible reactions of the victim against stalker (avoidance strategies, involvement of legal authorities or medical specialist). The victims themselves have indicated the psychological consequences of stalking: this fact has allowed to recognize psychopatological patterns like Adaptation Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Conclusion. So, the role of psychiatrist is not only to intervene when he can recognize those pathologies, but also to separate the persons who were in a good psycho-fisical balance from the others who had well-compensated behavoiural disorders or were carriers of evident behavioural disorders before stalking.

ABSTRACT: Designing new educational experiences, which utilize novel technologies, are usable by teachers and learners and integrate well into existing, everyday educational contexts is extremely difficult. In this paper we describe the process of Human Centred Design as a cyclic process of evolution. An initial system design vision is communicated to a range of stakeholders and revised as informed by feedback from these users to produce a modified vision. A cycle of presentations of the vision and modifications lead to the creation of system prototypes that are increasingly grounded in a genuine understanding of user needs and context. The latter stages of this process employ contextually evaluated semi-functional and functional prototypes, associated documentation and an iteratively refined framework for data capture and analysis. We use the HOMEWORK system development as a case study to demonstrate the use of this approach and to illustrate the benefits that user involvement in the design process can bring to bear upon the development of an Interactive Learning Environment. We describe the type of methodology that can help designers to reap these benefits and the resource implications arising from this work. We conclude that the key output from the design process at each phase is more than the latest version of the system prototype and a modified system vision; it is also the analytical methodology that has been iteratively developed in parallel to the system software. It is this meta level analytical map that can add rigor to the design process and help to make the findings generalise beyond the particular users involved in the design process. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

ABSTRACT: While human tutors typically interact with students using spoken dialogue, most computer dialogue tutors are text-based. We have conducted two experiments comparing typed and spoken tutoring dialogues, one in a human-human scenario, and another in a human-computer scenario. In both experiments, we compared spoken versus typed tutoring for learning gains and time on task, and also measured the correlations of learning gains with dialogue features. Our main results are that changing the modality from text to speech caused changes in the learning gains, time and superficial dialogue characteristics of human tutoring, but for computer tutoring it made less difference. © 2006 - IOS Press and t he authors.

ABSTRACT: Research and educational programs have the potential to improve health care. American Indians (AIs) suffer from considerable health disparities as compared with the general U.S. population, including significantly higher incidence and prevalence of preventable diseases like diabetes, alcoholism, and their complications. Underfunding of health programs, including the Indian Health Service, and lower socioeconomic status among AIs contribute to these disparities. Improvements in disease prevention and treatment potentially offered by research and health education programs could help to reduce health disparities. However, a history of nonparticipation in the research process and a history of dishonest research practices have raised barriers to conducting research in AI communities. Additional barriers are generated from a shortage of AI researchers and health care professionals. A research paradigm that includes the community as a full partner is necessary to promote research and education in AI communities and to translate health research into reductions in health disparities. © 2006, Sage Publications.

ABSTRACT: Heuristics play an important role in guiding the reasoning and confining the search area of a solution. The study of mental models in the domain of recursions showed that misconceptions are commonly happened among novices. It, thus, becomes an important research issue of how to convey the recursive concept more correctly and efficiently to students. To embark on this research, I focus on linear recursions first and leave multiple recursions for future study. In this paper, I presented a heuristic method to help learners discover linear recursive solutions for themselves.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the changes of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients, as well as its relationship with superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and neopterin (NPT). Methods: By the concentration of urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) and creatinine (Cr), 85 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients were divided into 4 groups as non-DN group (DM), early-staged DN group (DN3), significant DN group (DN4) and end-staged DN group (DN5). The concentration of the serum AOPP was measured by ameliorated method introduced by Wikto-Sarsat, while SOD by Xanthine oxidase test, GPx by [5,5′Dithio-bis (2-Nitrobenzoic aied)] (DTNB) reaction test and NPT by ELISA. Results: AOPP in Group DN5 [(117.8 ± 64.8) μmol/L] and Group DN4 [(80.0 ± 23.0) μmol/L] were significantly higher than those in Group DM [(58.2 ± 17.7) μmol/L]. There was no significant difference of AOPP between Group DN3 [(72.7 ± 17.2) μmol/L] and Group DM. Serum AOPP negatively correlated with SOD and GPx(r= -0.217 and -0.374 respectively, P < 0.05), while positively correlated with NPT (r = 0.499, P < 0.01). Conclusion: DN patient has enhanced protein oxidation than DM patient, which is related to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in DN.

ABSTRACT: This paper discusses the recent approaches for developing intelligent e-Learning systems. The paper presents Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and Ontology learning methodologies. These approaches address the problems found in the developing of learning, teaching and training systems, e.g. the problems of knowledge acquisition, representation, remembering, robust and maintenance. CBR receives increasing attention within the artificial intelligence in education community due to its ability for reasoning from experiences (old cases) in an effort to solve problems, critique solutions and explain anomalous situations. Ontology approach plays a crucial role in the learning process of the agent, as it is used as the generalization hierarchy for learning. However, this ontology is itself incomplete and partially is correct and will have to be improved during the teaching of the agent. The paper discusses the CBR and Ontology methodologies, the research issues and technical aspects of implementing effective intelligent e-learning systems. Some examples of successful applications in different domains are also given in the paper.

ABSTRACT: This paper explores a new higher education paradigm, given the changing environment that will come with the advance of globalization and the rapid development of the Internet. As economies revolve around a global network and the value of knowledge, societies rely on universities to help shape future education in an emerging knowledge society. As teachers are already finding that they need to adapt to the presence of the Internet, university managers and administrators will need to adapt their structures, strategies, procedures, and programs to deal with the processes of globalization. Based on international research, this paper presents a vision and a paradigm from which higher education might be constructed. The Sloan-C's Five Pillars to improve online learning and new applications, HyperReality and Croquet, are examined as potential platforms to reframe future developments. © 2005, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: To investigate the protein and mRNA expression patterns of apoptosis-related genes, together with evidence of apoptosis, in relation to experimental autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). Male C57BL/6 mice at 4 weeks age (n = 80) were randomly assigned to one of the five group (n = 16). The inbred mice were given a single subcutaneous injection of diluted solution of pertussis and an emulsion containing equal parts of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) and inner ear antigens (IEAg) extracted form guinea pig. The animals were sacrificed for inner ear examination at a defined time after the immunization (7, 14, 21 or 28 days). An autoimmune inner ear diseases model was established. Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (d-UTP) nick end-laying (TUNEL) method. Using immunohistochemical techniques and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to clarify the profile of Fas, FasL, and bcl-2. Under normal conditions, no TUNEL-positive cell was observed in the cochlea except for a few positive cells in the supporting cells of Corti's organ and macula sacculi. Inner ear antigens administration induced TUNEL-positive reactions in a wide variety of cells such as inner hair cells, supporting cells, stria vascularis and spiral ligament fibrocytes. No positive staining was evident in outer hair cells, spiral ganglion cells and Scarpa's ganglion cells during the whole period. Fas proteins were expressed in a wide range of cells in inner ear. The levels of Fas mRNA were no significant differences between normal and AIED mice. FasL and bcl-2 proteins could be detected in spiral ganglion cells and Scarpa's ganglion cells both in normal and AIED mice. FasL positive cells increased in number in inner ear of AIED mice. bcl-2 positive cells were not detectable in inner hair cells, stria vascularis and spiral ligament both in normal and AIED mice. The mRNA of three kinds of apoptosis-related genes was detectable in the normal and AIED mice. FasL mRNA was expressed at low levels in normal, being maximal at 14 d post inoculation and decreased gradually to steady levels by 2 weeks. The levels of bcl-2 mRNA increased significantly during the period of AIED. Apoptosis mediated by Fas/FasL signal system may play a role in the initiation and maintenance of AIED. bcl-2 has a crucial role in the regulation of the process of apoptosis in the inner ear of AIED mice.
