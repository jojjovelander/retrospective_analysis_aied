In these arguments, sustainable AI is proposed, which aims at advancing the pathway toward sustainability, such as sustainable energy. In this paper, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling combining LDA, BERT and Clustering. We then combined these computational analyses with content analysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly topics, sub-themes and cross-topic themes within scientific research on sustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics including sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management, climate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, convergence of AI with IoT, AI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering education and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future research strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. In addition to its theoretical contribution to scientific research on sustainable artificial intelligence in energy management, the research utilizes a novel topic modeling method in exploring scientific texts and identifying challenges and possible solutions. A variety of solutions was incorporated, including huggingface tool or elbow method, to address these challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Content analysis;  Energy;  Sustainability;  Sustainable energy;  Topic modelingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusAllen, B., McGough, A.S., Devlin, M.57221557233;8924270300;25824796200;Toward a Framework for Teaching Artificial Intelligence to a Higher Education Audience(2022) ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 22 (2), art. no. 3485062, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127170244&doi=10.1145%2f3485062&partnerID=40&md5=458c822cc4c17114fbb627bccbd085b6DOI: 10.1145/3485062ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence and its sub-disciplines are becoming increasingly relevant in numerous areas of academia as well as industry and can now be considered a core area of Computer Science [84]. The Higher Education sector are offering more courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence than ever before. However, there is a lack of research pertaining to best practices for teaching in this complex domain that heavily relies on both computing and mathematical knowledge. We conducted a literature review and qualitative study with students and Higher Education lecturers from a range of educational institutions, with an aim to determine what might constitute best practices in this area in Higher Education. We hypothesised that confidence, mathematics anxiety, and differences in student educational background were key factors here. We then investigated the issues surrounding these and whether they inhibit the acquisition of knowledge and skills pertaining to the theoretical basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This article shares the insights from both students and lecturers with experience in the field of AI and machine learning education, with the aim to inform prospective pedagogies and studies within this domain and move toward a framework for best practice in teaching and learning of these topics. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Pedagogy;  Self-efficacyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusLiu, S., Yu, J., Li, Q., Liang, R., Zhang, Y., Shen, X., Sun, J.56801211900;57497342700;57231011600;57192085319;57499224600;56939593600;36926215100;Ability boosted knowledge tracing(2022) Information Sciences, 596, pp. 567-587.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126628790&doi=10.1016%2fj.ins.2022.02.044&partnerID=40&md5=9472e3198e0e1507bb99e179e0873e60DOI: 10.1016/j.ins.2022.02.044ABSTRACT: Knowledge tracing (KT) has become an increasingly relevant problem in intelligent education services, which estimates and traces the degree of learner's mastery of concepts based on students’ responses to learning resources. The existing mainstream KT models, only attribute learners’ feedback to the degree of knowledge mastery and leave the influence of mental ability factors out of consideration. Although ability is an essential component of the problem-solving process, these knowledge-centered models cause a contradiction between data fitting and rationalization of the model decision-making process, making it difficult to achieve high precision and readability simultaneously. In this paper, an innovative KT model, ability boosted knowledge tracing (ABKT)1 is proposed, which introduces the ability factor into learning feedback attribution to enable the model to analyze the learning process from two perspectives, knowledge and ability, simultaneously. Based on constructive learning theory, continuous matrix factorization (CMF) model is proposed to simulate the knowledge internalization process, following the initiative growth and stationarity principles. In addition, the linear graph latent ability (LGLA) model is proposed to construct learner and item latent ability features, from graph-structured learner interaction data. Then, the knowledge and ability dual-tracing framework is constructed to integrate the knowledge and ability modules. Experimental results on four public databases indicate that the proposed methods perform better than state-of-the-art knowledge tracing algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy in quantitative assessments, displaying some advantages in model interpretability and intelligibility. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence in education;  Ensemble learning;  Graph neural networks;  Knowledge tracing;  Learner modeling;  Matrix factorizationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKhoury, P., Srinivasan, R., Kakumanu, S., Ochoa, S., Keswani, A., Sparks, R., Rider, N.L.36164232100;57219717332;57208045805;57220547974;24780930600;57190585039;15056496800;A Framework for Augmented Intelligence in Allergy and Immunology Practice and Research—A Work Group Report of the AAAAI Health Informatics, Technology, and Education Committee(2022) Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, 10 (5), pp. 1178-1188.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126388265&doi=10.1016%2fj.jaip.2022.01.047&partnerID=40&md5=1936a5bd2c23603806755d133d0aad11DOI: 10.1016/j.jaip.2022.01.047ABSTRACT: Artificial and augmented intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are expanding into the health care space. Big data are increasingly used in patient care applications, diagnostics, and treatment decisions in allergy and immunology. How these technologies will be evaluated, approved, and assessed for their impact is an important consideration for researchers and practitioners alike. With the potential of ML, deep learning, natural language processing, and other assistive methods to redefine health care usage, a scaffold for the impact of AI technology on research and patient care in allergy and immunology is needed. An American Academy of Asthma Allergy and Immunology Health Information Technology and Education subcommittee workgroup was convened to perform a scoping review of AI within health care as well as the specialty of allergy and immunology to address impacts on allergy and immunology practice and research as well as potential challenges including education, AI governance, ethical and equity considerations, and potential opportunities for the specialty. There are numerous potential clinical applications of AI in allergy and immunology that range from disease diagnosis to multidimensional data reduction in electronic health records or immunologic datasets. For appropriate application and interpretation of AI, specialists should be involved in the design, validation, and implementation of AI in allergy and immunology. Challenges include incorporation of data science and bioinformatics into training of future allergists-immunologists. © 2022AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Asthma;  Atopic dermatitis;  Augmented intelligence;  Clinical decision support;  Electronic health records;  Equity;  Machine learning;  Medical education;  Natural language processing;  Primary immunodeficiencyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusPolak, S., Schiavo, G., Zancanaro, M.57673041400;39062089100;6603368997;Teachers' Perspective on Artificial Intelligence Education: an Initial Investigation(2022) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, art. no. 431, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129703259&doi=10.1145%2f3491101.3519866&partnerID=40&md5=39ed2531d07ef161cc1e8fd5ad3966cdDOI: 10.1145/3491101.3519866ABSTRACT: Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers' perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process-including focus groups and a survey-needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives. © 2022 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI Education;  Computing education;  Digital CompetenciesDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusLee, S., Yun, J., Lee, S., Song, Y., Song, H.57673586500;57672486500;57673865100;57674402700;8909051200;Will AI Image Synthesis Technology Help Constructivist Education at The Online Art Museum?(2022) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, art. no. 319, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129691615&doi=10.1145%2f3491101.3519788&partnerID=40&md5=2c0cb85366afe848956b5b2c89d4f712DOI: 10.1145/3491101.3519788ABSTRACT: Motivated by the outbreak of COVID-19, museums have increased interests in online museum and online museum education. This study presents a way to use AI image synthesis technology for online art education guided by a constructivist design approach. An experiment was conducted to empirically test the effectiveness of AI-based art education in the online museum context. A total of 83 participants visited one of 3 different web-based art museums (i.e., AI image synthesis not applied vs. AI image synthesis applied with given photos vs. AI image synthesis applied with self-uploaded photos). Those who experienced the online museum with synthesized images using self-uploaded photos reported a higher level of motivation and satisfaction and to experience in a more constructivist way compared to other conditions. © 2022 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Art;  Computer Vision;  Education/Learning;  Quantitative MethodsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusGray, K., Slavotinek, J., Dimaguila, G.L., Choo, D.7202177088;7003497645;56901303200;57211684521;Artificial Intelligence Education for the Health Workforce: Expert Survey of Approaches and Needs(2022) JMIR Medical Education, 8 (2), art. no. e35223, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128474662&doi=10.2196%2f35223&partnerID=40&md5=ef18c87d1f80ad47bf4aecdf867ae605DOI: 10.2196/35223ABSTRACT: Background: The preparation of the current and future health workforce for the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is a growing concern as AI applications emerge in various care settings and specializations. At present, there is no obvious consensus among educators about what needs to be learned or how this learning may be supported or assessed. Objective: Our study aims to explore health care education experts' ideas and plans for preparing the health workforce to work with AI and identify critical gaps in curriculum and educational resources across a national health care system. Methods: A survey canvassed expert views on AI education for the health workforce in terms of educational strategies, subject matter priorities, meaningful learning activities, desired attitudes, and skills. A total of 39 senior people from different health workforce subgroups across Australia provided ratings and free-text responses in late 2020. Results: The responses highlighted the importance of education on ethical implications, suitability of large data sets for use in AI clinical applications, principles of machine learning, and specific diagnosis and treatment applications of AI as well as alterations to cognitive load during clinical work and the interaction between humans and machines in clinical settings. Respondents also outlined barriers to implementation, such as lack of governance structures and processes, resource constraints, and cultural adjustment. Conclusions: Further work around the world of the kind reported in this survey can assist educators and education authorities who are responsible for preparing the health workforce to minimize the risks and realize the benefits of implementing AI in health care. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

Conversational AI brings new possibilities for alternative and innovative Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools, such as AI chatbots. This paper reports on field experiments with an AI chatbot and provides insights into its contribution to Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). More specifically, this paper presents an experimental use case of an educational AI chatbot called AsasaraBot, designed to teach high school students cultural content in a foreign language, i.e., English or French. The content is related to the Minoan Civilization, emphasizing the characteristic figurine of the Minoan Snake Goddess. The related chatbot-based educational program has been evaluated at public and private language schools in Greece. The findings from these experiments show that the use of AI chatbot technology for interactive ICT-based learning is suitable for learning foreign languages and cultural content at the same time. The AsasaraBot AI chatbot has been designed and implemented in the context of a postgraduate project using open-source and free software. © 2022 by the authors.

In this article, we develop this relational and context-dependent analysis, arguing that ethics should not be understood as abstract values or design decisions, but as socio-technical achievements, enacted in the practices of students, teachers and corporations. We propose that the ethics of using AI in education are political, involving the distribution of power, privilege and resources. To illustrate this, we trace the controversies that followed from an incident in which a student was misclassified as a cheat by an online proctoring platform during the Covid-19 lockdown, analysing this incident to reveal the socio-technical arrangements of academic integrity. We then show how Joan Tronto’s work on the ethics of care can help think about the politics of these socio-technical arrangements — that is, about historically constituted power relations and the delegation of responsibilities within these institutions. The paper concludes by setting the immediate need for restorative justice against the slower temporality of systemic failure, and inviting speculation that could create new relationships between universities, students, businesses, algorithms and the idea of academic integrity. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Algorithms;  Artificial intelligence;  Care;  Ethics;  Higher education;  Online proctoringDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusXu, W., Ouyang, F.57302902300;57193380924;A systematic review of AI role in the educational system based on a proposed conceptual framework(2022) Education and Information Technologies, 27 (3), pp. 4195-4223.

However, most research has investigated AIEd from the technological perspective, which cannot achieve a deep understand of the complex roles of AI in instructional and learning processes and its relationship with other educational elements. To fill this gap, this review research proposes a conceptual framework from complex adaptive systems theory perspective, uses a systematic literature review approach to locate and summarize articles, and categorizes the roles of AI in the educational system. The review results indicate that when AI is added into an educational system, its roles can be characterized into three categories: AI as a new subject, AI as direct mediator, and AI as a supplementary assistant to influence the instructor-student, student-self, and student-student relationships. Reviewed articles under each category are examined to understand the influences of AI applications on instruction and learning. Based on the results, this systematic review research proposes practical, theoretical, and technological implications of AIEd development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI role;  Artificial intelligence;  Artificial intelligence in education;  Complex adaptive systems theory;  ComplexityDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusCoovert, M.D., Bennett, W., Jr6602828894;7402370383;The importance of identifying the dimensionality of constructs employed in simulation and training for AI(2022) Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation, 19 (2), pp. 229-236.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113171605&doi=10.1177%2f15485129211036936&partnerID=40&md5=f1a41f3cee5ae233c764fec439fa6831DOI: 10.1177/15485129211036936ABSTRACT: Advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and education and training are occurring at an ever-increasing pace. On the education and training side, psychological and performance constructs play a central role in both theory and application. It is essential, therefore, to accurately determine the dimensionality of a construct, as it is often employed during both the assessment and development of theory, and its practical application. Traditionally, both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses have been employed to establish the dimensionality of data. Due in part to inconsistent findings, methodologists recently resurrected the bifactor approach for establishing the dimensionality of data. The bifactor model is pitted against traditional data structures, and the one with the best overall fit (according to chi-square, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)) is preferred. If the bifactor structure is preferred by that test, it can be further examined via a suite of emerging coefficients (e.g., omega, omega hierarchical, omega subscale, H, explained common variance, and percent uncontaminated correlations), each of which is computed from standardized factor loadings. To examine the utility of these new statistical tools in an education and training context, we analyze data where the construct of interest is trust. We chose trust as it is central, among other things, to understanding human reliance upon and utilization of AI systems. We utilized the above statistical approach and determined the two-factor structure of widely employed trust scale is better represented by one general factor. Findings like this hold substantial implications for theory development and testing, prediction as in structural equation modeling (SEM) models, as well as the utilization of scales and their role in education, training, and AI systems. We encourage other researchers to employ the statistical measures described here to critically examine the construct measures used in their work if those measures are thought to be multidimensional. Only through the appropriate utilization of constructs, defined in part by their dimensionality, are we to advance the intersection of AI and simulation and training. © The Author(s) 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: bifactor model;  Construct;  factor analysis;  teamsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusFiok, K., Farahani, F.V., Karwowski, W., Ahram, T.36607907800;57040931600;35600960600;35097126400;Explainable artificial intelligence for education and training(2022) Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation, 19 (2), pp. 133-144.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110786169&doi=10.1177%2f15485129211028651&partnerID=40&md5=23df794d426c6c53760eddb837963c14DOI: 10.1177/15485129211028651ABSTRACT: Researchers and software users benefit from the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) to an unprecedented extent in various domains where automated intelligent action is required. However, as they continue to engage with AI, they also begin to understand the limitations and risks associated with ceding control and decision-making to not always transparent artificial computer agents. Understanding of “what is happening in the black box” becomes feasible with explainable AI (XAI) methods designed to mitigate these risks and introduce trust into human-AI interactions. Our study reviews the essential capabilities, limitations, and desiderata of XAI tools developed over recent years and reviews the history of XAI and AI in education (AIED). We present different approaches to AI and XAI from the viewpoint of researchers focused on AIED in comparison with researchers focused on AI and machine learning (ML). We conclude that both groups of interest desire increased efforts to obtain improved XAI tools; however, these groups formulate different target user groups and expectations regarding XAI features and provide different examples of possible achievements. We summarize these viewpoints and provide guidelines for scientists looking to incorporate XAI into their own work. © The Author(s) 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Explainable AI;  human-centered computing;  human–computer interaction;  rationale generation;  social training;  user perceptionDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKim, N.J., Kim, M.K.57420545300;55686386400;Teacher’s Perceptions of Using an Artificial Intelligence-Based Educational Tool for Scientific Writing(2022) Frontiers in Education, 7, art. no. 755914, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128424819&doi=10.3389%2ffeduc.2022.755914&partnerID=40&md5=b631b7c4ebf75f9892705c4a1d592365DOI: 10.3389/feduc.2022.755914ABSTRACT: Efforts have constantly been made to incorporate AI into teaching and learning; however, the successful implementation of new instructional technologies is closely related to the attitudes of the teachers who lead the lesson. Teachers’ perceptions of AI utilization have only been investigated by only few scholars due an overall lack of experience of teachers regarding how AI can be utilized in the classroom as well as no specific idea of what AI-adopted tools would be like. This study investigated how teachers perceived an AI-enhanced scaffolding system developed to support students’ scientific writing for STEM education. Results revealed that most STEM teachers positively experienced AI as a source for superior scaffolding. On the other hand, they also raised the possibility of several issues caused by using AI such as the change in the role played by the teachers in the classroom and the transparency of the decisions made by the AI system. These results can be used as a foundation for which to create guidelines for the future integration of AI with STEM education in schools, since it reports teachers’ experiences utilizing the system and various considerations regarding its implementation.

Students have different corresponding relationships under digital behavior. The interactive technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) provides a new driving force for the development of art education and psychology. Firstly, this thesis analyzes the limitations and existing problems of traditional art education. Especially, the influence of the teaching mode of art education on the teaching of other disciplines develops a targeted student-centered digital education program. Secondly, the author used VR equipment and technology to let students experience the virtual world freely, and then, the relevant data model was established on the basis of analyzing the reasons affecting students’ creativity and concentration. Thirdly, the data model was applied to art education in order to improve students’ concentration and creativity. Then, the author compared and analyzed the data of the students under different teaching models through questionnaires. The results show that introducing VR and AI technology into art education and encouraging students to carry out deep learning can significantly improve student concentration and creativity. Finally, the influence reasons are analyzed from the perspective of psychology.

In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven learning analytics tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI-specific misconceptions, myths, and fears (i.e., mass unemployment and ethical concerns). In recent years, artificial intelligence has been introduced increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers regarding the use and adoption of AI-based Educational Technology (EdTech). The present study introduces a new instrument to measure teachers' trust in AI-based EdTech, provides evidence of its internal structure validity, and uses it to portray secondary-level school teachers' attitudes toward AI. First, we explain the instrument items creation process based on our preliminary research and review of existing tools in other domains. Second, using Exploratory Factor Analysis we analyze the results from 132 teachers' input. The results reveal eight factors influencing teachers' trust in adopting AI-based EdTech: Perceived Benefits of AI-based EdTech, AI-based EdTech's Lack of Human Characteristics, AI-based EdTech's Perceived Lack of Transparency, Anxieties Related to Using AI-based EdTech, Self-efficacy in Using AI-based EdTech, Required Shift in Pedagogy to Adopt AI-based EdTech, Preferred Means to Increase Trust in AI-based EdTech, and AI-based EdTech vs Human Advice/Recommendation. Finally, we use the instrument to discuss 132 high-school Biology teachers' responses to the survey items and to what extent they align with the findings from the literature in relevant domains. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it introduces a reliable instrument to investigate the role of teachers' trust in AI-based EdTech and the factors influencing it. Second, the findings from the teachers' survey can guide creators of teacher professional development courses and policymakers on improving teachers' trust in, and in turn their willingness to adopt, AI-based EdTech in K-12 education. © 2022 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Blended Learning;  Human Factors;  K-12 Education;  Teachers;  TrustDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusShin, H., Sindi, N., Lee, Y., Ka, J., Song, J.Y., Kim, J.57202043125;57223406704;57224003420;57559048800;57559048900;39361826000;XDesign: Integrating Interface Design into Explainable AI Education(2022) SIGCSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V.2, p. 1097.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127431506&doi=10.1145%2f3478432.3499052&partnerID=40&md5=0c1ddb4056a69ab02bd0d157628c43d3DOI: 10.1145/3478432.3499052ABSTRACT: We introduce XDesign, a web-based interactive platform that guides learners through a multi-stage design process for creating user-centered explanations of AI models.

The data of KoE transcriptions collected from 30 native English speakers (NSs) and two AI apps were examined. The NSs group identified the words related to three LFC features significantly better than the AI apps, while with no significant difference, both groups recognized least frequently and with most difficulty the words that had non-LFC features. Despite NSs often performing better in the KoE intelligibility test, AI apps can capture speech realization at a level similar to the NSs (a moderate correlation found). The current results support the variability of both LFC and non-LFC feature sets and the novel application of the LFC analysis. Identifying difficult (less/least intelligible) English phonemes of KoE to NSs and to AI apps, we recommend that the variability of the LFC feature set should be taken into account in English language education and that learners should aim to communicate intelligibly with humans with various accents, by practicing/communicating with current available AI apps to make ready for the AI-Intervened/Mediated Circle. © 2022 AsiaTEFL.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: computer-assisted language learning;  intelligibility;  Korean-accented English;  mobile-assisted language learning;  pronunciation teachingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusHamal, O., El Faddouli, N.-E., Alaoui Harouni, M.H., Lu, J.57207732368;54784300600;57223147635;57220698310;Artificial Intelligent in Education(2022) Sustainability (Switzerland), 14 (5), art. no. 2862, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125793882&doi=10.3390%2fsu14052862&partnerID=40&md5=124000749c3ae96aee230c397afabcdfDOI: 10.3390/su14052862ABSTRACT: The application of Artificial Intelligence or AI in education has been the subject of academic research for more than 30 years. The field examines learning wherever it occurs, in traditional classrooms or at workplaces so to support formal education and lifelong learning. It combines interdisciplinary AI and learning sciences (such as education, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, sociology and anthropology) in order to facilitate the development of effective adaptive learning environments and various flexible, inclusive tools. Nowadays, there are several new challenges in the field of education technology in the era of smart phones, tablets, cloud computing, Big Data, etc., whose current research questions focus on concepts such as ICT-enabled personalized learning, mobile learning, educational games, collaborative learning on social media, MOOCs, augmented reality application in education and so on. Therefore, to meet these new challenges in education, several fields of research using AI have emerged over time to improve teaching and learning using digital technologies. Moreover, each field of research is distinguished by its own vision and methodologies. In this article, to the authors present a state of the art finding in the fields of research of Artificial Intelligence in Education or AIED, Educational Data Mining or EDM and Learning Analytics or LA. We discuss their historical elements, definition attempts, objectives, adopted methodologies, application examples and challenges. © 2022 by the authors.

This development increasingly calls for citizens to have a basic understanding of programming and computational thinking (PCT). Accordingly, countries worldwide are implementing several approaches to integrate critical elements of PCT into K-9 education. However, these efforts are confronted by difficulties that the PCT concepts are for students to grasp from purely theoretical perspectives. Recent literature indicates that the playful nature is particularly important when novices from both both early and higher education are to learn AI. These playful activities are characterised by setting a scene where PCT concepts such as algorithms, data processing, and simulations are meant to draw on to understand better how AI is integrated into our everyday digital life. This discussion paper analyses playful PCT resources developed around the game rock-paper-scissors developed in the UK and Denmark. Resources from these countries are interesting starting points since both have been or are in the process of integrating PCT as part of the K-9 curriculum. The central discussion raised by the paper, is the nature of the integration between mathematics and PCT in these tasks. These resources provide opportunities for discussion of how we may better integrate PCT and mathematics from the perspective of both subjects to build a solid foundation for a critical understanding of AI interactions in future generations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Computational thinking;  Learning programming;  Mathematics educationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKirubarajan, A., Young, D., Khan, S., Crasto, N., Sobel, M., Sussman, D.57203429542;57224997922;57200823141;57239853400;36195827500;36638418300;Artificial Intelligence and Surgical Education: A Systematic Scoping Review of Interventions(2022) Journal of Surgical Education, 79 (2), pp. 500-515.

We systematically searched eight interdisciplinary databases including MEDLINE-Ovid, ERIC, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science: Core Collection, Compendex, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Databases were searched from inception until the date of search on April 13, 2021. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We only examined original, peer-reviewed interventional studies that self-described as AI interventions, focused on medical education, and were relevant to surgical trainees (defined as medical or dental students, postgraduate residents, or surgical fellows) within the title and abstract (see Table 2). Animal, cadaveric, and in vivo studies were not eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: After systematically searching eight databases and 4255 citations, our scoping review identified 49 studies relevant to artificial intelligence in surgical education. We found diverse interventions related to the evaluation of surgical competency, personalization of surgical education, and improvement of surgical education materials across surgical specialties. Many studies used existing surgical education materials, such as the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills framework or the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set database. Though most studies did not provide outcomes related to the implementation in medical schools (such as cost-effective analyses or trainee feedback), there are numerous promising interventions. In particular, many studies noted high accuracy in the objective characterization of surgical skill sets. These interventions could be further used to identify at-risk surgical trainees or evaluate teaching methods. CONCLUSIONS: There are promising applications for AI in surgical education, particularly for the assessment of surgical competencies, though further evidence is needed regarding implementation and applicability. © 2021 Association of Program Directors in SurgeryAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  machine learning;  surgery;  surgical education;  technologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHu, Y.-H.57223101412;Effects and acceptance of precision education in an AI-supported smart learning environment(2022) Education and Information Technologies, 27 (2), pp. 2013-2037.

The LAD basically tracks and visualizes traces of learning actions to make students aware of their learning behaviors and reflect these against the agreed goals. This research aims to realize the digital transformation of the learning space, thereby improving students’ learning outcomes with the assistance of the learning dashboard. To examine whether there was a close relationship between the frequency of using the whole platform and academic results, the data was collected from 50 first-year university students who registered with the innovative thinking course. Based on the data, we constructed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire and interview guide to realize the students’ acceptance and feedback towards the SLE. Students were clustered into high-mark and low-mark groups based on their final results. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used to identify a significant difference between the two groups using the precision education platform. Subsequently, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is further utilized to analyze the relationship between system quality, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness on behavioral intention and learning transfer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Architectures for educational technology system;  Improving classroom teaching;  Teaching/learning strategiesDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMacLellan, C.J., Koedinger, K.R.23492963300;6603678234;Domain-General Tutor Authoring with Apprentice Learner Models(2022) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 32 (1), pp. 76-117.

Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 1, 94–111 2013). However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10, 98–129, 1999). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25(1), 1–34 2014) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale. © 2020, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Authoring tools;  Intelligent tutoring systems;  Interactive machine learning;  Simulated agentsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusLee, I., Zhang, H., Moore, K., Zhou, X., Perret, B., Cheng, Y., Zheng, R., Pu, G.37049104500;57203798086;57484049800;57217589045;57484049900;57484216900;57483538200;57483206800;AI Book Club: An Innovative Professional Development Model for AI Education(2022) SIGCSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, 1, pp. 202-208.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126104078&doi=10.1145%2f3478431.3499318&partnerID=40&md5=2ad8edf15e49b24ab0aa8bd59dcbd8a9DOI: 10.1145/3478431.3499318ABSTRACT: This paper describes an AI Book Club as an innovative 20-hour professional development (PD) model designed to prepare teachers with AI content knowledge and an understanding of the ethical issues posed by bias in AI that are foundational to developing AI-literate citizens. The design of the intervention was motivated by a desire to manage the cognitive load of AI learning by spreading the PD program over several weeks and a desire to form and maintain a community of teachers interested in AI education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each week participants spent an hour independently reading selections from an AI book, reviewing AI activities, and viewing videos of other educators teaching the activities, then met online for 1 hour to discuss the materials and brainstorm how they might adapt the materials for their classrooms. The participants in the AI Book Club were 37 middle school educators from 3 US school districts and 5 youth-serving organizations. The teachers are from STEM disciplines as well as Social Studies and Art. Eighty-nine percent were from underrepresented groups in STEM and CS. In this paper we describe the design of the AI Book Club, its implementation, and preliminary findings on teachers' impressions of the AI Book Club as a form of PD, thoughts about teaching AI in classrooms, and interest in continuing the book club model in the upcoming year. We conclude with recommendations for others interested in implementing a book club PD format for AI learning. © 2022 Owner/Author.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: ai education;  ai literacy;  book club;  professional development;  teacher preparationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusChiu, T.K.F., Meng, H., Chai, C.-S., King, I., Wong, S., Yam, Y.56435413000;7202279063;7201358969;7102275781;35076873300;7005965300;Creation and Evaluation of a Pretertiary Artificial Intelligence (AI) Curriculum(2022) IEEE Transactions on Education, 65 (1), pp. 30-39.

This study added to the AI education community by introducing a new AI curriculum framework. The preposttest multifactors evaluation about students' perceptions of AI learning confirmed that the curriculum is effective in promoting AI learning. The teachers also confirmed the co-creation process enhanced their capacity to implement AI education. Background: AI4Future is a cross-sector project that engages five major partners - CUHK's Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Education, secondary schools, Hong Kong government, and AI industry. A team of 14 professors collaborated with 17 principals and teachers from six secondary schools to co-create the curriculum. Research Questions: Would the curriculum significantly improve the student perceived competence, attitude, and motivation toward AI learning? How does the co-creation process benefit the implementation of the curriculum? Methodology: The participants were 335 students and eight teachers from the secondary schools. This study adopted a mix-method with quantitative data measures at pre- and post-questionnaires and qualitative data emphasizes teachers' perspectives on the co-creation process. Paired {t} -tests and ANCOVAs, and thematic analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings: 1) students perceived greater competence and developed a more positive attitude to learn AI and 2) the co-creation process enhanced teachers' knowledge in AI, as well as fostered teachers' autonomy in bringing the subject matter into their classrooms. © 1963-2012 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence (AI) education;  co-creation process;  curriculum design;  pretertiary education;  teacher educationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusYang, S., Stansfield, K.50862066000;57194467039;AI Chatbot for Educational Service Improvement in the Post-Pandemic Era: A Case Study Prototype for Supporting Digital Reading List(2022) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 24-29.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129189680&doi=10.1145%2f3514262.3514289&partnerID=40&md5=9742d5cdd8f04a83a12b2c9307f00b77DOI: 10.1145/3514262.3514289ABSTRACT: This paper describes the development of an educational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot prototype to support teachers in developing digital reading lists for their students. The chatbot aims to teach users how to use an educational system-Talis Aspire-effectively by giving them quick answers to questions, offering demonstrations and instructions on how to complete essential tasks on Talis Aspire, advising them how to solve problems and providing solutions for common issues. We have presented the prototype, together with the approach we used to design and develop it by considering the concepts of Recontextualisation' and Quality Function Deployment'. We argue that the use of chatbot technology can not only help tutors develop online education and teaching materials but may also improve the quality of educational services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Global education systems are leaning towards a more personalized, student-centered approach. Innovations like Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have given the modern-day technology to accommodate the distinctive features of human beings - smart machines and computers have been built to understand individual-specific needs. This opens an avenue for “personalization” in the education sector. From, mushrooming of Education Technology (EdTech) start-ups to government funding in AI research, it is evident that the next generation educational reforms would take a quantum leap forward piloted by Big Data analysis and AI. The objective of this paper is to organize the vast literature on the use of AI for personalization of education and to shed light on the key themes by which an AI-driven approach makes structural modifications to the existing education system. To this effect, the paper employed a systematic review using a Human-In-The-Loop natural language processing model of past two years' literature (2019–2021) in English language from IEEE Xplore on countries China, India and the USA. This process yielded more than 2000 search results at first and these were eventually shortlisted to 353 relevant papers for in-depth analysis. Being the pioneers in EdTech innovations, insights from research done in these three countries provides valuable input for the development of global education systems and research. The findings bring forward AI's success in catering to specific learning requirements, learning habits, and learning abilities of students and guiding them into optimized learning paths across all three countries. Not just that, it is also evident from the literature that AI augments educational content, customizes it for any individual according to their needs, and raises the flag of caution for anticipated learning difficulties. This recalibrates the role of instructors as well as optimizes the teaching-learning environment for a better learning experience. The upward trajectory of educational development with AI opens a new horizon of personalized education for the future generation, but also comes with its challenges. Data privacy issues, availability of digital resources, and affordability constraints have been reported in the recent literature as impediments in the way of promoting such technologies for day-to-day practice. © 2022 The AuthorAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Big data;  China;  India;  Personalized education;  USADOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusKay, J., Bartimote, K., Kitto, K., Kummerfeld, B., Liu, D., Reimann, P.7201938514;57680811200;26646667100;6507828228;7410100594;23973559200;Enhancing learning by Open Learner Model (OLM) driven data design(2022) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, art. no. 100069, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129952395&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2022.100069&partnerID=40&md5=2cfc2698eb555d7f27befbc820de4c80DOI: 10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100069ABSTRACT: There is a huge and growing amount of data that is already captured in the many, diverse digital tools that support learning. Additionally, learning data is often inaccessible to teachers or served in a manner that fails to support or inform their teaching and design practice. We need systematic, learner-centred ways for teachers to design learning data that supports them. Drawing on decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research, we show how to make use of important AIED concepts: (1) learner models; (2) Open Learner Models (OLMs); (3) scrutability and (4) Ontologies. We show how these concepts can be used in the design of OLMs, interfaces that enable a learner to see and interact with an externalised representation of their learning progress. We extend this important work by demonstrating how OLMs can also drive a learner-centred design process of learning data. We draw on the work of Biggs on constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996, 1999, 2011), which has been so influential in education. Like Biggs, we propose a way for teachers to design the learning data in their subjects and we illustrate the approach with case studies. We show how teachers can use this approach today, essentially integrating the design of learning data along with the learning design for their subjects. We outline a research agenda for designing the collection of richer learning data. There are three core contributions of this paper. First, we present the terms OLM, learner model, scrutability and ontologies, as thinking tools for systematic design of learning data. Second, we show how to integrate this into the design and refinement of a subject. Finally, we present a research agenda for making this process both easier and more powerful. © 2022 The AuthorsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Learner models;  Learning analytics;  Ontologies;  Open Learner Models (OLMs);  Scrutability;  Self-regulated learning;  Student modelsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusHoward, S.K., Swist, T., Gasevic, D., Bartimote, K., Knight, S., Gulson, K., Apps, T., Peloche, J., Hutchinson, N., Selwyn, N.35219969300;36018875500;8549413500;57680811200;53984324100;8315805000;57201558713;57681210900;57681494600;55882979400;Educational data journeys: Where are we going, what are we taking and making for AI?(2022) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, art. no. 100073, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129918015&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2022.100073&partnerID=40&md5=4f94f9fdcfc6e4400498f0e5dd974b7dDOI: 10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100073ABSTRACT: Educational systems generate huge quantities of digital data. Digital educational data is captured and used at all points – from classrooms and schools, to the level of educational departments. As growing trends in ‘data-driven instruction’ suggest, all these data have great potential to support student, teacher and leadership practices, help guide work and learning decisions, and inform policy development. Moreover, an increasing focus is being placed on the development of artificial intelligence to automate and improve how data are used. Yet, stakeholder data practices remain invisible and little understood, which complicates how artificial intelligence can be embedded in this context. In this paper, we introduce an educational data journeys framework to frame dynamics of data power, data work, identities and literacies. This approach is employed to explore educational policy revealing data flows and frictions in school improvement and implications for the development of artificial intelligence in education. © 2022 The AuthorsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Data journeys;  Data practices;  Educational data;  Educational policy;  InfrastructureDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusKrajcer, Z.7006289806;Artificial Intelligence for Education, Proctoring, and Credentialing in Cardiovascular Medicine(2022) Texas Heart Institute Journal, 49 (2), art. no. e217572, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129779454&doi=10.14503%2fTHIJ-21-7572&partnerID=40&md5=7f72afbfb92c17fe5ad0abb9b47a7585DOI: 10.14503/THIJ-21-7572ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly gaining popularity in every aspect of cardiovascular medicine. This review discusses the past, present, and future of artificial intelligence in education, remote proctoring, credentialing, research, and publication as they pertain to cardiovascular procedures. This review describes the benefits and limitations of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the exciting potential of integrating advanced simulation, holography, virtual reality, and extended reality into disease diagnosis and patient care, as well as their roles in cardiovascular research and education. Nonetheless, much of the available data resides in electronic medical records or within industry-sponsored pro-prietary programs that are not compatible or standardized for current clinical application. Many areas in cardiovascular medicine would benefit from the introduction or increased use of artificial intelligence. Web-based artificial intelligence applications could be used to address unmet needs for education, on-demand procedural proctoring, credentialing, and recredentialing for interventionists and physicians in remote locations. Further progress in artificial intelligence will require further collaboration among computer scientists and re-searchers in order to identify and correct the most relevant problems and to implement the best data-based approach to achieving this goal. The future success of artificial intelligence in cardiovascular medicine will depend on the degree of collaboration between all pertinent experts in this field. This will undoubtedly be a prolonged, stepwise process. © 2022 by the Texas Heart ® Institute, Houston.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  cardiovascular surgical procedures;  creden-tialing;  diagnostic techniques, cardiovascular/ methods/trends;  education;  imaging, three-dimensional;  investigative techniques;  machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusZhang, H., Lee, I., Ali, S., DiPaola, D., Cheng, Y., Breazeal, C.57203798086;37049104500;57207448534;57208863454;57224784955;7003691791;Integrating Ethics and Career Futures with Technical Learning to Promote AI Literacy for Middle School Students: An Exploratory Study(2022) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129775591&doi=10.1007%2fs40593-022-00293-3&partnerID=40&md5=024b9d9c03d6ea5f2bb36a1ec877f382DOI: 10.1007/s40593-022-00293-3ABSTRACT: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) necessitates promoting AI education at the K-12 level. However, educating young learners to become AI literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of AI literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about AI as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of AI: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the AI era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students’ learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of AI concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how AI may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained AI as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into AI education is age appropriate and effective for developing AI literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of AI Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of AI that is appropriate for middle school students. © 2022, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI ethics;  Bias;  Career implications;  Middle school education;  Sociotechnical systemsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusPrahani, B.K., Rizki, I.A., Jatmiko, B., Suprapto, N., Amelia, T.57207944019;57671590500;57191163601;57163917500;57195509420;Artificial Intelligence in Education Research During the Last Ten Years: A Review and Bibliometric Study(2022) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, 17 (8), pp. 169-188.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129689528&doi=10.3991%2fijet.v17i08.29833&partnerID=40&md5=8e11400ccd25eb3dc0e14895e2e49903DOI: 10.3991/ijet.v17i08.29833ABSTRACT: Research on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has increased rapidly in recent years, so efforts are needed to understand the status of trends and their development to support and focus these trends.

Users who adopt online and mobile learning mode present explosive growth. Due to free of time and space limits like traditional classroom teaching and possessing of rich education video resources, online learning is attracting many learners to engage in studies independently. In the future, intelligent and individualized online education development shall pay more attention to influence factors of learners’ learning outcomes, especially learning emotion of learners, except for knowledge teaching and acceptance. In this study, a questionnaire concerning influences of learning emotion of learners on learning outcome was designed based on existing studies. Learning emotion of learners influences learning outcome through four aspects, including learning interest, learning attitude, learning belief and learning motivation. Results demonstrate that learning interest, learning attitude and learning motivations can improve learning outcomes significantly. There are significant differences of learning outcomes among different grades and the latest comprehensive assessment levels. Conclusions can provide important references for universities to make scientific reforms in online teaching mode to increase learning experiences of learners. © 2022.

In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI-specific misconceptions, myths and fears (e.g., mass unemployment and privacy violations). In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI-powered Educational Technology (AI-EdTech). This paper sheds light on teachers' trust in AI-EdTech and presents effective professional development strategies to increase teachers' trust and willingness to apply AI-EdTech in their classrooms. Our experiments with K-12 science teachers were conducted around their interactions with a specific AI-powered assessment tool (termed AI-Grader) using both synthetic and real data. The results indicate that presenting teachers with some explanations of (i) how AI makes decisions, particularly compared to the human experts, and (ii) how AI can complement and give additional strengths to teachers, rather than replacing them, can reduce teachers' concerns and improve their trust in AI-EdTech. The contribution of this research is threefold. First, it emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI-EdTech in K-12 education. Second, it presents a teacher professional development program (PDP), as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it. Third, based on the results observed, it presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming to improve teachers' trust in AI-EdTech. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Human factors, and especially trust, play a critical role in practitioners' adoption of technology. In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K-12 education. Little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI-powered Educational Technology. What this paper adds This research emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI-EdTech in K-12 education. It presents a teacher professional development program (PDP) to increase teachers' trust in AI-EdTech, as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it. It presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming at improving teachers' trust in AI-EdTech. Implications for practice and/or policy Pre- and in-service teacher education programs that aim to increase teachers' trust in AI-EdTech should include a section providing teachers with a basic understanding of AI. PDPs aimed to increase teachers' trust in AI-EdTech should focus on concrete pedagogical tasks and specific AI-powered tools that are considered by teachers as helpful and worth the effort to learn. AI-EdTech should not restrict teachers to follow specific pedagogical scenarios, but rather provide teachers with the freedom to design and implement various types of pedagogies that meet their preferences, students' needs, and classroom reality. Teacher agency is key to gaining their trust. AI-EdTech should allow teachers to review, modify, and if necessary, override AI-based recommendations before they are sent to students. © 2022 The Authors.

Teaching the principles and requirements of ethical AI to students is considered an essential part of this domain, with an increasing number of technical AI courses taught at several higher-education institutions around the globe including content related to ethics. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic topic model, this study uncovers topics in teaching ethics in AI courses and their trends related to where the courses are taught, by whom, and at what level of cognitive complexity and specificity according to Bloom's taxonomy. In this exploratory study based on unsupervised machine learning, we analyzed a total of 166 courses: 116 from North American universities, 11 from Asia, 36 from Europe, and 10 from other regions. Based on this analysis, we were able to synthesize a model of teaching approaches, which we call BAG (Build, Assess, and Govern), that combines specific cognitive levels, course content topics, and disciplines affiliated with the department(s) in charge of the course. We critically assess the implications of this teaching paradigm and provide suggestions about how to move away from these practices. We challenge teaching practitioners and program coordinators to reflect on their usual procedures so that they may expand their methodology beyond the confines of stereotypical thought and traditional biases regarding what disciplines should teach and how. ©2022 AI Access Foundation.

However, limited research has been conducted that looks into the validity of trace-based measurement protocols. In order to fill this gap in the literature, we propose a novel validation approach that combines theory-driven and data-driven perspectives to increase the validity of interpretations of SRL processes extracted from trace-data. The main contribution of this approach consists of three alignments between trace data and think aloud data to improve measurement validity. In addition, we define the match rate between SRL processes extracted from trace data and think aloud as a quantitative indicator together with other three indicators (sensitivity, specificity and trace coverage), to evaluate the “degree” of validity. We tested this validation approach in a laboratory study that involved 44 learners who learned individually about the topic of artificial intelligence in education with the use of a technology-enhanced learning environment for 45 minutes. Following this new validation approach, we achieved an improved match rate between SRL processes extracted from trace-data and think aloud data (training set: 54.24%; testing set: 55.09%) compared to the match rate before applying the validation approach (training set: 38.97%; test set: 34.54%). By considering think aloud data as “reference point”, this improvement of the match rate quantified the extent to which validity can be improved by using our validation approach. In conclusion, the novel validation approach presented in this study used both empirical evidence from think aloud data and rationale from our theoretical framework of SRL, which now, allows testing and improvement of the validity of trace-based SRL measurements. © 2022, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Measurement validity;  Self-regulated learning;  Think aloud data;  Trace dataDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusYang, X., Zhang, H., Chen, R., Li, S., Zhang, N., Wang, B., Wang, X.57668741400;57668411500;57488248200;57488132100;57203097982;57668411600;57669404800;Research on Forecasting of Student Grade Based on Adaptive K-Means and Deep Neural Network(2022) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2022, art. no. 5454158, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129492784&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f5454158&partnerID=40&md5=f48a05f7bae8b2964d6a23c5372b4847DOI: 10.1155/2022/5454158ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in AIEd (AI empowers education industry). In this paper, we conduct mining and prediction of influencing factors of student performance based on education data set. First, we apply data mining and analysis methods to two public educational data sets. Next, we further analyze the results through visual analysis method and try to explain the physical meaning. Then, we screened the feature data through two computing methods based on random forest algorithm. Finally, we predicted the student performance through an improved model based on K-means and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Our results show that the proposed model feature selection Adaptive-K-means-DNN obtains the best mean of squared residuals both in two student learning data sets; the results demonstrating that the feature selection processing and the employment of the adaptive K-means have enhanced the prediction performances significantly. Furthermore, we also find that mother's education is the direct influence of the students' final grade, the difference is there is no strong correlation between absences and the students' final grade, but absences is still an important factor affecting the students' final grade, and it may affect the students' final grade through other factors; moreover, the failures also has a strong correlation between the students' final grade, and it also is a direct influence indicator for the students' final grade; in summary, the influence of mother's education on students' performance is very important. The management of students' classroom absence will effectively improve students' final performance. In addition, regular encouragement may be a good way for students to improve their learning performance. © 2022 Xinfen Yang et al.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusSu, J., Zhong, Y.57443505800;57555776300;Artificial Intelligence (AI) in early childhood education: Curriculum design and future directions(2022) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, art. no. 100072, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129155311&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2022.100072&partnerID=40&md5=4c15f97aa9aa8d1059387c46b02854abDOI: 10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100072ABSTRACT: With the rapid technological development of society brought on by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the demand for AI-literate workers will increase in the future. It is critical to develop the next generation's AI competencies and educate them about how to work with and use AI. Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education; however, research on the Artificial Intelligence curriculum in early childhood education is scarce. Due to the lack of conformity on the standardisation of AI curriculum for early childhood education, this study examines the AI curriculum for kindergarten children using the framework which consists of four key components, including (1) aims, goals, objectives, or declarations of outcome, (2) subject matter, domains, or content, (3) methods or procedure, (4) evaluation and assessment. We recommend that AI literacy be achieved by three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles. We also discovered which teaching methods had the most greatest influence on students' learning. We recommend problem-based learning for future AI education based on the findings. © 2022 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI curriculum;  AI literacy;  Artificial intelligence (AI);  Early childhood education;  KindergartenDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusTanaka, M.S., Miyazaki, K., Shin, M., Ito, T.57191908735;57189309776;57189304179;57189307517;PBL Education Support System to Visualize Students' Attitudes(2022) LifeTech 2022 - 2022 IEEE 4th Global Conference on Life Sciences and Technologies, pp. 196-197.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129142263&doi=10.1109%2fLifeTech53646.2022.9754787&partnerID=40&md5=416c48523ccfa62a178cec1ac7cbdbcaDOI: 10.1109/LifeTech53646.2022.9754787ABSTRACT: We have built a system that supports PBL education called AI teachers. In this paper, we will introduce the mechanism and effect of group activities supported by AI teachers. In particular, we will explain the advice function for students using an emotion analysis. The problem of group activity was that when the students were divided into multiple groups and did group work in breakout rooms, the teacher could not grasp the situation of the students. Teachers can check by entering the breakout room of each group in turn, but teachers cannot see the whole at once. AI teachers have the ability to leave the voice of group activities as text. By utilizing this function, teachers can now give appropriate advice to each group. However, it takes some time to understand the student situation from the texts. Therefore, we added the emotion analysis to this function to improve the understanding the situation so that teachers can visually grasp the student's situation. In this paper we reports the details of this function and the results of its use. © 2022 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Emotional analysis;  Group activity;  PBL;  Speech recognitionDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLi, X., Taber, K.S.57643376600;57645596300;The Future of Interaction: Augmented Reality, Holography and Artificial Intelligence in Early Childhood Science Education(2022) Lecture Notes in Educational Technology, pp. 415-442.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128986436&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-0568-1_18&partnerID=40&md5=bb37fb3ee5b99d1b946f5b99e2cd4b73DOI: 10.1007/978-981-19-0568-1_18ABSTRACT: There is little doubt that the development of technology has changed the landscape of science learning in both formal and informal settings. However, often existing research studies lack a strong conceptual underpinning in terms of pedagogic theory. Regardless of the fair body of studies relating to early childhood education and science education, early childhood science learning remains a relatively under-researched area. As representatives of advanced technologies which have been widely adopted in many fields, augmented reality (AR), holography and artificial intelligence (AI) have rarely been applied and studied in early childhood science education despite the enormous potential they offer. Drawing upon Vygotsky’s notions of the zone of proximal development (ZPD), tools and mediation, this chapter provides a new perspective by exploring the potential use of AR applications (apps), holography and AI-based tools in early childhood science education. The key argument is that these tools can potentially change the nature of the interaction between learners and learning materials, and they offer significant affordances in early childhood science education. The mission of the present chapter is to inform the design and development of educational technology based on psychological and pedagogical perspectives, and help parents and early childhood teachers understand the potential use of AR, holography and AI in science education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in education;  AR in education;  Holography in education;  Mediation;  Scaffolding learning;  Zone of proximal developmentDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusJayasundara, S., Indika, A., Herath, D.57216416974;57642564900;57196087300;Interpretable Student Performance Prediction Using Explainable Boosting Machine for Multi-Class Classification(2022) ICARC 2022 - 2nd International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing: Towards a Digitally Empowered Society, pp. 391-396.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128883399&doi=10.1109%2fICARC54489.2022.9753867&partnerID=40&md5=a7d93b1ee70f98884cfcddf36a9c08c9DOI: 10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753867ABSTRACT: Students' performance prediction can have many uses in the education sector. It helps to take measures to support struggling students and to improve course delivery. However, having meaningful explanations along each prediction is essential for the reliability of the predictions and hence is desirable. In this work, we propose a method for predicting student performance while generating explanations of the predictions made. An Explainable Boosting Machine is implemented to suit multi-class classification to achieve the mentioned objective. The classification performance of the proposed approach is compared with similar supervised learning models, namely a linear model, a decision tree, and a decision rule-based approach for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. Results show that the Explainable Boosting Machine ranks second in classification performance. At the same time, it provides global and local explanations of the predictions, which are further shown to be consistent with the observations made in feature selection. The proposed approach and its extensions can help in predicting student performance while enabling the interpretation of the predictions made. It will enable educators to devise strategies to improve students' performance. © 2022 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in Education;  Explainable Boosting Machine;  Interpretable Machine Learning;  XAIDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLameras, P., Paraskakis, I., Konstantinidis, S.37561547200;24385774100;22035124900;A Rudimentary Progression Model for Artificial Intelligence in Education Competencies and Skills(2022) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 411 LNNS, pp. 927-936.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128761597&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-96296-8_84&partnerID=40&md5=7576bf44ed2d47849ad2db6cfa7ba5a7DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-96296-8_84ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence in Education is progressing with accelerated pace, and this impacts the role of the teacher in becoming catalyst in designing and orchestrating teaching and learning with the use of AI-based systems. This study proposes a rudimentary competency framework with an associated progression model that aims to help teachers to plan, develop, self-assess, and reflect on existing and new competencies for teaching and learning through AI-based systems. The framework encompasses six competency themes along with six relational and inclusive descriptors of competency progression levels that may be used either as standalone or as a concerted set of competencies for enabling complete and holistic conceptualisations, and utilizations of competencies and capabilities that teachers may envisage to develop for making the leap into adaptive and automated AI-based teaching and learning. The AIED Comp framework may inform computational representation models and algorithms that focus on teacher-facing AIED applications and tools for gaining insights on skills and capabilities teachers may employ for innovating in their classroom. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AIED competencies;  Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED);  Progression model;  Teachers;  Teaching and learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMisthou, S., Paliouras, A.57226721658;57613463400;Teaching Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education: Competences and Interventions(2022) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 411 LNNS, pp. 887-896.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128720334&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-96296-8_80&partnerID=40&md5=ab8ad01c05b569c427996064076b1f43DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-96296-8_80ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the strategic importance of artificial intelligence (AI) to all the governments around the world. However, governments do not seem to have understood to the same extent how AI can be implemented, so they are not taking advantage of its potential. Education plays a critical role in efforts to make future workforces AI-ready. It is an emergency the development of digital skills especially in matters of AI and it becomes clear that in order to ensure that a country has the trained and talented workforce needed to implement artificial intelligence in the economy and society, it is essential to invest in STEM and AI education that can give students the skills and opportunities to pursue a career in STEM. As is well known, creating the next generation of scientists, leaders and entrepreneurs takes time and it’s nurtured over many years, starting at an early age in school. The curricular reform efforts outlined in this paper clearly demonstrate the need to define the journey in ‘AI competences’ in K-12 education that incorporates 21st century skills. The paper explores the AI skills and competences that need to be developed in primary and secondary education and presents some implementations of AI-based interventions in the classroom using voice assistants. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence competences;  K-12 education;  Voice assistantsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusGao, X., Chen, W.57608866600;57607270200;Brand LOGO Image Recognition and Inquiry Creative Teaching Design Based on Deep Learning(2022) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2022, art. no. 5396468, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128664975&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f5396468&partnerID=40&md5=1ce5be8732cb48e9ff0e29914cf736a7DOI: 10.1155/2022/5396468ABSTRACT: In order to develop more reasonable and scientific teaching equipment and software and improve the diversity of teaching process, LOGO image recognition technology is used to build a development environment in experiment, with Unity 3D as the development platform and Vuforia AR SDK as the development tool. LOGO image recognition technology is applied to the case study of high school inquiry teaching. By the way of classroom teaching practice and teacher-student interview, the application effect of LOGO image recognition technology in teaching is evaluated, and the effectiveness of this technology in inquiry teaching practice is verified by practical data.

The education reform in the intelligent environment is urgent. Under this background, the theory, methods, and characteristics of intelligent music education are expounded based on traditional piano music education. AI and Internet-based smart piano education is introduced. The characteristics of smart piano and its methods of assisting music teaching are analyzed. Moreover, literature review and questionnaire are adopted based on intelligent music education and smart piano theory. With two universities A and B in Nanjing as the research object, the questionnaire is designed to investigate and analyze the related problems of smart piano-assisted piano basic teaching in detail. The results show that smart piano positively improves skill training and psychological training in piano teaching. Piano major learners believe that smart piano can obviously help beginners and people with low piano levels. However, smart piano is not as good as traditional piano for high-level learners. In actual teaching, teachers should use different strategies for different levels of learners. Regarding curriculum quality, teachers have not fully played the role of the smart piano, and the curriculum of smart piano-assisted basic piano teaching still needs improvement. Finally, corresponding countermeasures and suggestions for the development direction of smart piano in piano music education are put forward according to the current situation of the smart piano. The results can reflect the current situation of smart piano-assisted basic piano teaching, provide a reference for researchers in related industries, and promote the related development of smart piano. © 2022 Linna Yu and Zhifan Luo.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusMegahed, N.A., Abdel-Kader, R.F., Soliman, H.Y.55941539500;26532393000;35191315100;Post-pandemic Education Strategy: Framework for Artificial Intelligence-Empowered Education in Engineering (AIEd-Eng) for Lifelong Learning(2022) Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies, 113, pp. 544-556.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128601726&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-03918-8_45&partnerID=40&md5=f4c6f82aa80c77cb2654f3353c533899DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-03918-8_45ABSTRACT: The unprecedented rate of technological advancements led by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is transforming teaching and learning.

Despite some doubts and fears, many studies suggest that AI could offer advantages to education, and AI-based applications have been developed for teaching and learning, and English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms in particular. One way to understand whether AI could be harmful or beneficial to EFL teaching and learning is to see from the teachers' perceptions. Hence, this study investigated how teachers perceive the use of AI in their EFL classrooms. The data was collected through interviews with four EFL teachers in a university in Indonesia who have had the experience of integrating AI in their teaching practices. The results show that all teachers had positive perceptions towards the use of AI in their classrooms. The teachers agreed that AI could help teachers teach and students learn. Moreover, the interview data also indicates that students' motivational levels and teachers' technological and pedagogical competence should be put into consideration when integrating AI into EFL classrooms. © 2022 Language Institute, Thammasat University.

In practice, a lifelong learning process is becoming an inevitable trend in the future. Although distance education has been developed for a long period, there are still problems such as low learning enthusiasm, low autonomy, and unsatisfactory learning support services. The application of AI to distance education will fundamentally affect the instruction and guidance methods, as well as the instructing content of distance education. Evolutions in distance education have brought significant changes in the instructing mode, learning strategy and support service, evaluation mode, and instructing platform of distance education. Distance education can construct an intelligent education platform to provide learners with personalized learning support. It can also offer flexible, dynamic, and convenient evaluation and on-demand learning resources with guaranteed quality. By leveraging the state-of-the-art data mining technique, we in this work design a set of simple yet effective distance education system, in the context of video conferencing. Our technique depends on the existing video surveillance network and equipment. Our technique can be applied to achieve an effective face-to-face online interaction. Meanwhile, the video surveillance network switch is optimized to enhance the network transmission and ensure the reliability of network operation.

In the past, only basic emotions are the focus of research but now, with advancement in technology and need along with basic emotion, reorganization of compound emotions is also getting important. But, recognizing facial expressions with accuracy is challenging. To deal with that, facial action units for detecting appropriate basic and compound facial emotion are useful. Among state-of-the-art methods for FER systems, detection of facial action units (AUs) showed good results. Combining these AUs to detect particular basic and compound facial expressions is key and improves the accuracy of basic and compound facial expressions. We have used standard CNN architecture VGGNet, XceptionNet, and ResNet to conduct experiments in the proposed method to explore CNN architecture that best performs for action unit recognition. We modified them slightly by changing a few final fully connected layers to detect facial action unit intensity. Using this modified architecture for CK+, MMI, DISFA, and DISFA+ database that detects action units with good accuracy, it is intern mapped to find basic and compound facial emotions. Our Proposed method achieves an overall accuracy for Action Unit detection using Xceptionnet network for MMI & DISFA are, giving promising results average F1- score is 72% and 74%, respectively. In contrast, a network for CK+ and DISFA+ has an overall F1- score is 62% for both. © 2022 National Research Nuclear University.

Machine learning is capable of classifying the existing data and can predict and forecast results. The evaluation of student performance in educational institutions reveals the degree of effort that educational institutions should do in order to improve the poor or average learner. The importance of using EDM models is that they leverage prior data from students to forecast unanticipated or impending student performance. Though the educational sector employs a variety of techniques to extract meaningful information about the characteristics of students who participate in the learning process, a student performance assessment model is required to assist students and faculty in moving their performance to the next level. This paper describes a machine learning based framework for forecasting student performance. Model makes use of three machine learning algorithms namely- Support vector Machine, Random Forest and Regression Analysis. The experimental findings have demonstrated that the performance of SVM is concerned with the student's performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Higher education institutions (HEI) have started to utilize Internet technologies to improve the quality of the service and boost knowledge. Due to the unavailability of information technology (IT) infrastructures*HEI is vulnerable to cyberattacks. Biometric authentication can be used to authenticate a person based on biological features such as face, fingerprint, iris, and so on. This study designs a novel search and rescue optimization with deep learning based learning authentication technique for cybersecurity in higher education institutions, named SRODLLAC technique. The proposed SRODL-LAC technique aims to authenticate the learner/student in HEI using fingerprint biometrics. Besides, the SRODLLACtechnique designs a median filtering (MF) based preprocessing approach to improving the quality of the image. In addition, the Densely Connected Networks (DenseNet-77) model is applied for the extraction of features. Moreover, search and rescue optimization (SRO) algorithm with deep neural network (DNN) model is utilized for the classification process. Lastly, template matching process is done for fingerprint identification. A wide range of simulation analyses is carried out and the results are inspected under several aspects. The experimental results reported the effective performance of the SRODL-LAC technique over the other methodologies. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, one big challenge is still the language barrier: Most courses are available in English, but only 16% of the world’s population speaks English [1]. The language challenge is especially evident in written exams, which are usually not provided in the student’s native language. To overcome these inequities, we analyze AI-driven cross-lingual automatic short answer grading. Our system is based on a Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model [2] and is able to fairly score free-text answers in 26 languages in a fully-automatic way with the potential to be extended to 104 languages. Augmenting training data with machine translated task-specific data for fine-tuning even improves performance. Our results are a first step to allow more international students to participate fairly in education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence in education;  Cross-lingual automatic short answer grading;  Deep learning;  Natural language processingDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusWang, T., Cheng, E.C.K.55535720400;57551891000;Towards a Tripartite Research Agenda: A Scoping Review of Artificial Intelligence in Education Research(2022) Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies, 104, pp. 3-24.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127074202&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-7527-0_1&partnerID=40&md5=d7311d806e17f8be4b47dd8a3eacf14dDOI: 10.1007/978-981-16-7527-0_1ABSTRACT: This paper reports on a scoping review of research studies on artificial intelligence in education (AIED) published over the last two decades (2001–2021).

(3) It clarifies the knowledge and skills required of students majoring in data science. (4) It assigns a time to each educational content so that the curriculum size becomes approximately 675 class hours (60 credits in the Japanese credit system). (5) It collaborates with the Model Curriculum for Mathematics, Data Science and AI Education (literacy level) developed by the Japan Inter-University Consortium for Mathematics and Data Science, supported by the Japanese government. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Computer science;  Curriculum development;  Data management;  Data science;  Data scientist certification;  Software engineering;  StatisticsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusWang, Y.57549836900;Controversial Issues Faced by Intelligent Tutoring System in Developing Constructivist-Learning-Based Curriculum(2022) Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies, 104, pp. 301-312.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127027456&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-7527-0_22&partnerID=40&md5=949764f4a4e8611bdbeebf3b61b4eddfDOI: 10.1007/978-981-16-7527-0_22ABSTRACT: This article aims at exploring the identified benefits and challenges when integrating Educational Artificial Intelligence (AIEd) into contemporary Constructive-Learning-Based Curriculum design. It is argued that the Intelligent Tutoring System, which lies at the centre of AIEd, could help enhancing learners’ constructive learning experience by providing personalised and engaging learning environment, and it could promoting learners’ twenty-first century skills during the learning process. However, biased data in the Intelligent Tutoring System may also give rise to learning recommendation bias and inequality. Also, the algorithms in Intelligent Tutoring System is uncapable of capturing unquantifiable learning information, and put its emphasize mainly on the quantifiable educational recommendations, that will deteriorate the construction of the Constructivist-Learning-Based Curriculum. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Constructivist Learning;  Curriculum;  Intelligent Tutoring SystemDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusChen, Y.-H., Huang, N.-F., Tzeng, J.-W., Lee, C.-A., Huang, Y.-X., Huang, H.-H.57317137200;55891644100;47862355700;57195286236;57447207800;57447207900;A Personalized Learning Path Recommender System with LINE Bot in MOOCs Based on LSTM(2022) 2022 11th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology, ICEIT 2022, pp. 40-45.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126883847&doi=10.1109%2fICEIT54416.2022.9690754&partnerID=40&md5=afdb6af5006e34d86ac668e4ee406653DOI: 10.1109/ICEIT54416.2022.9690754ABSTRACT: MOOCs has a great impact on nowadays educational strategies. MOOCs enable global learners to learn without time and space constraints, allowing distinct learning characteristics when participating in online courses. Overwhelmed by complicated learning resources, a problem named 'information overload' was widely discussed in online education. AI-based Recommender System, which is recognized as the powerful solution to improve resource acquisition via customized supply, has been regarded as an assistant in online learning by giving personalized learning strategies. In this paper, a Personalized Learning Path Recommender System with LINE Bot is proposed to meet personal preferences on path of learning. A LSTM model is built to consider video-watching preference features, clusters of students and learning paths to recommend personal learning path suitable for each student. Related recommendation contents and prediction results will be received by users through in-time LINE massages, achieving the goal of making in-time and active recommendations. From the evaluation part, F1-score of the proposed Learning Path Prediction Model is 0.8, indicating this model has a certain degree of accuracy. On the other hand, the proposed system is used in two courses of NTHU Cloud to give personalized learning path guidance. The experimental results demonstrate that learning path recommendations will help students have stronger learning willingness to keep learning, and help plan proper study steps to fulfill their own learning needs. On the other hand, this system provides another way except examinations to make judgements about one's learning status, and most learners agree that this kind of recommendations is helpful to review unfamiliar concepts and catch up with others. © 2022 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Knowledge Map;  Learning Path;  LSTM Neural Networks;  MOOCs;  Personalized RecommendationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusQin, H., Wang, G.57543015800;57543015900;Benefits, Challenges and Solutions of Artificial Intelligence Applied in Education(2022) 2022 11th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology, ICEIT 2022, pp. 62-66.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126872003&doi=10.1109%2fICEIT54416.2022.9690739&partnerID=40&md5=cc7ff66110c200b833e486246e67b3bfDOI: 10.1109/ICEIT54416.2022.9690739ABSTRACT: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, it brings several novel ideas for further developing education. In this paper, we first introduce the benefits of artificial intelligence applied in education from the perspectives of students, teachers and educational administrators. To be specific, artificial intelligence can help students achieve personalized learning, help teachers conduct targeted teaching and help educational administrators make decisions. However, artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword, and thus we also analyze four serious challenges caused by the application of artificial intelligence in education, including incomplete algorithm design, insufficient labelled data, excessive technical dependence and unreliable security guarantee. To promote the healthy development of artificial intelligence in education, we finally explore the feasible solutions to the proposed challenges in turn, which are user-driven design, scientific labelling, rational use and security enhancement, respectively. © 2022 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  benefits;  challenges;  solutionsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSayed Al Mnhrawi, D.N.T.A., Alreshidi, H.A.57539870900;55270225400;A systemic approach for implementing AI methods in education during COVID-19 pandemic: higher education in Saudi Arabia(2022) World Journal of Engineering, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126813646&doi=10.1108%2fWJE-11-2021-0623&partnerID=40&md5=cafaf8654ca75c1f8ae782b2a238918aDOI: 10.1108/WJE-11-2021-0623ABSTRACT: Purpose: The outbreak of COVID-19 has projected prominent threats to the learning and teaching environment.

Qualitative data was collected in interviews with seven experts from four companies, and the data was analysed using inductive content analysis. The four main areas of challenges were ambiguous regulations, inequalities in human learning, ethical dilemmas in machine learning (ML) and lack of ability to assess consequences in society. According to the studied companies, AI regulations are difficult to understand and implement. There is also much to be done in terms of reliability, transparency, and safety. Consequently, companies suggested that AI-based products should be more preventive, safe, explicable, and equally accessible. Sufficient information, multi-professional support also within company, global collaboration, sharing best practices, and general discussion were emphasised. The results show that EdTech companies are aware of their ethical challenges, and their responsibility as disseminators of information. However, translating information into practice is challenging because it is often very fragmented and difficult to understand. Companies hoped that everyone: themselves, consumers, educational institutions, researchers, funders, and decision-makers would do more together to overcome the ethical challenges of AI. © 2022 The Author(s).

This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world. © 2022 The AuthorAUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI literacy;  Artificial intelligence education;  Digital equity;  Early childhood education;  Pedagogical considerationsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusGabriel, F., Marrone, R., Van Sebille, Y., Kovanovic, V., de Laat, M.57220338344;57203360344;56453253200;55096902400;8218596300;Digital education strategies around the world: practices and policies(2022) Irish Educational Studies, 41 (1), pp. 85-106.

This study presents a review of 10 countries, highlighting how different public education systems have integrated digital technologies for teaching and learning. These education systems were selected based on their high performance and continuous improvement in international assessments. Four main themes emerged as key areas of focus from our analysis: improved and enhanced teaching and learning; digital maturation, including tackling the first and second digital divide; data-driven decision making and evidence-based education; and AI in education. Our findings will help benchmark current approaches and uses of digital teaching and learning, including perceived challenges and opportunities that can be used to inform the development and implementation of digital education policies. © 2022 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: digital education;  digital learning;  education policy;  educational technologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusGayed, J.M., Carlon, M.K.J., Oriola, A.M., Cross, J.S.57280427400;57215307959;57470231900;7402349007;Exploring an AI-based writing Assistant's impact on English language learners(2022) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, art. no. 100055, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125482510&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2022.100055&partnerID=40&md5=6ab11943170db88d51b6a9068b30141bDOI: 10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100055ABSTRACT: The increasing use of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) worldwide has brought attention to tools that can assist English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in their journey to fluency. Much research has shown that EFL learners often do not have sufficient latitude to output at a satisfactory level when writing in a second language. In addition, cognitive (working memory) resources are spent on low-level writing tasks (word production, translation) at the expense of time being allocated to higher-level writing tasks such as organization and revision. The researcher's laboratory developed an AI-based web application called “AI KAKU” to assist EFL learners in reducing the cognitive barriers they face when producing written text in English. While there has been much research and discussion on Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) technologies or older technologies such as spell check and grammar check, few studies have attempted to use AI-based tools as learning instruments outside assessments. This study recruited adult EFL participants in a counter-balanced experiment to evaluate the potential impact of AI KAKU on student writing. Preliminary results indicate that this is a potentially useful tool for English language learners who need more structured assistance than traditional word processors. © 2022AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI agent;  AI in education;  CALL;  Cognitive load;  L2 writingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusMarkauskaite, L., Marrone, R., Poquet, O., Knight, S., Martinez-Maldonado, R., Howard, S., Tondeur, J., De Laat, M., Buckingham Shum, S., Gašević, D., Siemens, G.56431399100;57203360344;57190012456;53984324100;55255183300;35219969300;22037160300;8218596300;7004820886;8549413500;36844717000;Rethinking the entwinement between artificial intelligence and human learning: What capabilities do learners need for a world with AI?(2022) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, art. no. 100056, .

What kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with AI? How can we conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their development? With this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. Engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values. © 2022 The AuthorsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in education;  Capabilities for AI;  Ecological approach;  Postdigital dialogueDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusCarvalho, L., Martinez-Maldonado, R., Tsai, Y.-S., Markauskaite, L., De Laat, M.55426912700;55255183300;57193766658;56431399100;8218596300;How can we design for learning in an AI world?(2022) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, art. no. 100053, .

It is predicted that many people will find themselves unprepared to deal with high degrees of change and uncertainty, increasingly posed by AI in some sectors. A critical educational challenge involves figuring out how to support young generations to develop the capabilities that they will need to adapt to, and innovate in, a world with AI. This article argues that both educators and learners should be involved not only in learning but also in co-designing for learning in an AI world. Further, they together should explore the knowledge, goals and actions that could help people shape future AI scenarios, and learn to deal with high degrees of uncertainty. A key contribution of the paper is a re-conceptualization of design for learning in an AI world, which explores a problem space of educational design, and illustrates how educators and learners can work together to re-imagine education futures in an AI world. As part of this problem space, the paper discusses underpinning philosophies (the capability approach and value creation), a high-level pedagogy (with an emphasis on co-creation), pedagogical strategies (speculative pedagogies), and pedagogical tactics (AI scenarios). It then proposes a design framework (ACAD) to support educators and learners' discussions about design for learning in an AI world. This participatory design approach aims to sensitize people for what education may mean, for whom, and how learning with AI may look like, and it highlights the active engagement of educators and learners in co-designing a future they desire, to help shape learning and living in an AI world. © 2022 The AuthorsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Capability approach;  Design for learningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusOuyang, F., Zheng, L., Jiao, P.57193380924;57467343500;55604705500;Artificial intelligence in online higher education: A systematic review of empirical research from 2011 to 2020(2022) Education and Information Technologies, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125240207&doi=10.1007%2fs10639-022-10925-9&partnerID=40&md5=1edb570de509a5e4981a2ad5f92c1651DOI: 10.1007/s10639-022-10925-9ABSTRACT: As online learning has been widely adopted in higher education in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has brought new ways for improving instruction and learning in online higher education. However, there is a lack of literature reviews that focuses on the functions, effects, and implications of applying AI in the online higher education context. In addition, what AI algorithms are commonly used and how they influence online higher education remain unclear. To fill these gaps, this systematic review provides an overview of empirical research on the applications of AI in online higher education. Specifically, this literature review examines the functions of AI in empirical researches, the algorithms used in empirical researches and the effects and implications generated by empirical research. According to the screening criteria, out of the 434 initially identified articles for the period between 2011 and 2020, 32 articles are included for the final synthesis. Results find that: (1) the functions of AI applications in online higher education include prediction of learning status, performance or satisfaction, resource recommendation, automatic assessment, and improvement of learning experience; (2) traditional AI technologies are commonly adopted while more advanced techniques (e.g., genetic algorithm, deep learning) are rarely used yet; and (3) effects generated by AI applications include a high quality of AI-enabled prediction with multiple input variables, a high quality of AI-enabled recommendations based on student characteristics, an improvement of students’ academic performance, and an improvement of online engagement and participation. This systematic review proposes the following theoretical, technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of educational and learning theories into AI-enabled online learning; (2) the adoption of advanced AI technologies to collect and analyze real-time process data; and (3) the implementation of more empirical research to test actual effects of AI applications in online higher education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence in Education;  Empirical research;  Online higher education;  Online learning;  Systematic reviewDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusDavy Tsz Kit, N.G., Luo, W., Chan, H.M.Y., Chu, S.K.W.57463704800;57463874100;57208334793;9943688000;Using digital story writing as a pedagogy to develop AI literacy among primary students(2022) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, art. no. 100054, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125120249&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2022.100054&partnerID=40&md5=d2c619a4e4f6828eebe00f233ada370eDOI: 10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100054ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is widely recognized as a new set of competencies that people use AI effectively and ethically in everyday life. In K-12 education, educators have started to employ different pedagogical strategies to foster students' AI literacy. Using digital story writing (DSW) in the classroom is an effective inquiry-based pedagogical approach to address literacy development by improving language and technological abilities across disciplines. This study recruited 82 primary students in Hong Kong to attend a three-month DSW journey to learn AI and completed a knowledge test at the end of the program. Among the students, 16 best-achieving students were further invited to participate in artefact-based interviews, and we further analysed their work to understand how they formulate AI understandings. It is found that the participating students were able to propose an authentic scenario, apply their new knowledge of AI and think up meaningful AI-driven solutions in their digital stories. Furthermore, we examined students' DSW process in terms of inquiry-based pedagogical cycle (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) to demonstrate how they learn AI. Overall, DSW as an inquiry could effectively foster students' AI literacy in using and applying AI knowledge to solve real-life problems, far beyond merely knowing and understanding related concepts. We suggest that using DSW as a pedagogy has the potential to support students to scaffold students’ AI understanding, particularly for young children. © 2022 The AuthorsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  AI ethics;  AI literacy;  Artificial intelligence (AI);  Digital story writing;  Inquiry-based learningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusKiv, A.E., Semerikov, S.O., Shyshkina, M.P., Striuk, A.M., Striuk, M.I., Yechkalo, Y.V., Mintii, I.S., Nechypurenko, P.P., Kalinichenko, O.O., Kolgatina, L.S., Vlasenko, K.V., Amelina, S.M., Semenikhina, O.V.6602488378;56375008500;56289490700;57194524952;57216845494;57204963622;57204971103;57194519666;57222574729;56529712600;57201618561;57211133370;56667616000;9th Workshop on Cloud Technologies in Education: Report(2022) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3085, pp. I-IXXVII.

However, AISE, which is today mainly based on the use of deep learning (DL) neural networks, is still under development. This makes the education of AI software engineers particularly challenging, since there are no well-established methodologies, tools and practices, like in traditional Software Engineering (SE) education drawing on decades of experience and methods in all phases of software development, from requirements analysis over design and implementation to integration and testing. We analyze the main differences between traditional SE and AISE education and address challenges in AISE education. Our methodology is based on literature survey, analysis of own industry experience and statistical analysis of students works on AI applications. Our goal is to provide guidelines for an AISE process and propose a curriculum path for AISE education, which can be used to update a traditional SE curriculum. According to results of our analysis, the main challenges for the students are: Dealing with data and taking into account that algorithms change (learn) by data, selection and re-use of AI algorithms, model test, maintenance and automatizing the AISE process. We propose to address these challenges in SE curricula by teaching more statistical thinking with connections to software development, developing re-engineering capabilities, teaching a model-based AI approach and combining AI with virtual reality simulations. In the whole process, we consider an optimal division of work between humans and AI systems by explicitly including humans in the AISE loop. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Deep learning;  Machine learning;  Software education;  Software engineeringDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusFujishima, S., Takemata, K., Minamide, A.57223008783;7004362172;7004007133;Poster: Practical Examples of Basic Data Science Course for Junior High and High School Students in Club Activity(2022) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 390 LNNS, pp. 449-455.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124766633&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-93907-6_47&partnerID=40&md5=3392cf067c728a60950abd969c0c7246DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-93907-6_47ABSTRACT: Under the new curriculum guidelines issued by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan, programming education will be expanded in junior high schools from 2021 and will become a compulsory subject in high schools from 2022. Therefore, junior high school and high school teachers need to plan their course contents for programming courses using information and communication technology. We have organized basic data science course for junior high and high school students with the aim of cooperating with them. In this project, the course is designed to provide students with the basic knowledge of data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In order to understand basic mechanisms of machine learning and importance of dataset quality, the course materials include not only hands-on AI practice using tool on a PC, but also hand calculations on handout. The results of the questionnaire show that more than 80% of the students were interested in our course, understood the importance of dataset quality, and became more familiar with data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Basic AI education;  Data science;  High school;  Junior high school;  Machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMakarov, T.G., Arslanov, K.M., Kobchikova, E.V., Opyhtina, E.G., Barabanova, S.V.57215364423;57189361885;57215341489;57454200200;55336457300;Legal Aspects of Using Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education(2022) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 389 LNNS, pp. 286-295.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124659559&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-93904-5_29&partnerID=40&md5=91f348ee32a193698f9bd8dd4d0b0c08DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-93904-5_29ABSTRACT: Currently, artificial intelligence techniques are actively used in various areas of social life. In higher education, using these techniques is of special interest to both teaching staff and legal community. Statutory regulation of artificial intelligence in the system of higher education is at a not very high level as of today, despite using at some universities really advanced artificial-intelligence technologies. Authors of this paper have tried to develop a comprehensive scientific concept of the legal aspects of using artificial intelligence in higher education. We analyzed the notion of artificial intelligence and other terms in the area under research, considered the matter of the legal nature of artificial intelligence systems, defined the prospects of legally regulating the relationships to using artificial intelligence in education, and investigated the possibility of instituting civil-law sanctions for artificial intelligence operation in education. Undoubtedly, onrush of and using artificial intelligence systems in higher education need sound legal support. Legal enactments to be adopted in the area under research must consider both artificial intelligence techniques that are currently used by the institutions of higher education and those to be developed in the nearest future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Higher education;  LawDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusTreacy, D.57209469720;Appreciating situations of breakdown for researcher reflexivity(2022) Action Research, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124605185&doi=10.1177%2f14767503211073083&partnerID=40&md5=21cc33b6a3dd29cd64e485b4c2ddfaf8DOI: 10.1177/14767503211073083ABSTRACT: Responding to the identified need for reflection, critique, and evaluations of appreciative inquiry (AI), a form of action research, this article presents a critical reflection on an application of AI in a cross-cultural music education research project. AI was selected as it appeared to both have potential for addressing the complexities related to power imbalances, ethnocentrism, and coloniality inherent in a project aiming to co-develop music teacher education in Finland and Nepal, and because its 4D model supported the co-constructing of visions, which was central to the project. The critical reflection presented in this article focused on three situations of breakdown that occurred during the research process. Analysis of these breakdowns highlighted the need for researchers to engage responsibly in research as participants, account for dreaming as an unevenly distributed capacity when working with visions or aspirations, and develop skills facilitating collaborative spaces that cultivate listening for and appreciating difference. The article concludes by recognising the limitations of undertaking this reflection independently rather than collaboratively and by cautioning against the instrumentalization of appreciation, calling instead for sincere appreciation. Overall, the article contends that the process of identifying and generating new understandings of breakdowns is a powerful approach for stimulating researcher reflexivity. © The Author(s) 2022.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: ap preciative inquiry;  cross-cultural research;  music education research;  reflexivity;  research ethicsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusLi, C., Xing, W., Leite, W.L.57208421439;55983407600;23393086500;Toward building a fair peer recommender to support help-seeking in online learning(2022) Distance Education, 43 (1), pp. 30-55.

However, the asynchronicity and information overload of online discussion forums have made it challenging for help seekers and providers to connect effectively. This study formulated a new method to provide fair and accurate insights toward building a peer recommender to support help-seeking in online learning. Specifically, we developed the fair network embedding (Fair-NE) model and compared it with existing popular models. We trained and evaluated the models with a large dataset consisting of 187,450 discussion post-reply pairs by 10,182 Algebra I online learners from 2015 to 2020. Finally, we examined models with representation fairness, predictive accuracy, and predictive fairness. The results showed that the Fair-NE can achieve superior fairness in genders and races while retaining competitive predictive accuracy. This study marks a paradigm change from previous investigation and evaluation of fair artificial intelligence to proactively build fair artificial intelligence in education. © 2022 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: fair artificial intelligence;  help-seeking;  online discussion forums;  peer recommendersDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusChen, X., Zou, D., Xie, H., Cheng, G., Liu, C.57031196900;56319369100;57244661700;35995385400;57469344600;Two Decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Contributors, Collaborations, Research Topics, Challenges, and Future Directions(2022) Educational Technology and Society, 25 (1), pp. 28-47.

Those having had monthly ABD were more likely to be AI and have less education; those having had EABD were more likely to be AI, male, younger, have less education and lower economic status compared to participants without ABD. ABD/EABD was associated with higher impulsivity, a family history of AUD, and lower level of response to alcohol (ORs = 1.0-2.0), as well as with adult AUD (ORs = 3.7-48), other substance use disorders (ORs = 3.5-9), and conduct disorder/antisocial personality disorder (ORs = 2.0-2.6), but not with anxiety/depression. Monthly EABD further increased the odds of AUD/SUD.Conclusions:Although binge drinking was more common in AI compared to MA, there were little effects of race in individual risk factor analyses. Monthly ABD and EABD were common among these AI/MA as adolescents, and, as with other ethnic groups, these drinking patterns resulted in highly significant increases in the odds of developing alcohol and other substance use disorders in young adulthood.

As AI technologies are new to K-12 schools, there is a lack of studies that inform how to design learning when AI is introduced as a collaborative learning agent to classrooms. The present study, therefore, aimed to explore teachers’ perspectives on what (1) curriculum design, (2) student-AI interaction, and (3) learning environments are required to design student-AI collaboration (SAC) in learning and (4) how SAC would evolve. Through in-depth interviews with 10 Korean leading teachers in AI in Education (AIED), the study found that teachers perceived capacity and subject-matter knowledge building as the optimal learning goals for SAC. SAC can be facilitated through interdisciplinary learning, authentic problem solving, and creative tasks in tandem with process-oriented assessment and collaboration performance assessment. While teachers expressed instruction on AI principles, data literacy, error analysis, AI ethics, and AI experiences in daily life were crucial support, AI needs to offer an instructional scaffolding and possess attributes as a learning mate to enhance student-AI interaction. In addition, teachers highlighted systematic AIED policy, flexible school system, the culture of collaborative learning, and a safe to fail environment are significant. Teachers further anticipated students would develop collaboration with AI through three stages: (1) learn about AI, (2) learn from AI, and (3) learn together. These findings can provide a more holistic understanding of the AIED and implications for the educational policies, educational AI design as well as instructional design that are aimed at enhancing SAC in learning. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in education;  Distributed cognition;  Learning design;  Student-AI collaborationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusDyulicheva, Y.Yu., Glazieva, A.O.56669951600;57432906800;Game based learning with artificial intelligence and immersive technologies: an overview(2022) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3077, pp. 146-159.

We performed a systematic review of original studies evaluating the attitudes of radiologists, radiology trainees, and medical students towards AI in radiology. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed for studies published as of August 24, 2021 for original studies evaluating attitudes of radiologists (attendings and trainees) and medical students towards AI in radiology. We summarized the baseline article characteristics and performed thematic analysis of the questions asked in each study. Results: Nineteen studies were included evaluating attitudes across different levels of training (medical students, radiology trainees, and radiology attendings) with representation from nearly every continent. Medical students and radiologists alike favored increased educational initiatives, and displayed interest in learning about and implementing AI solutions themselves, despite reporting of a current gap in formal AI training. There was general optimism about the role of AI in radiology, although radiologists and trainees had greater consensus than medical students. Conclusion: Although there is interest in incorporating AI into medical education and optimism among radiologists towards AI, medical students are more divided in their views. We propose that outreach to and AI education for medical students may help improve their attitudes towards the potentially transformative technology of AI for radiology. © 2022 The Association of University RadiologistsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  attitudes;  radiology;  systematic reviewDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusKim, J., Shim, J.57432147400;56118822900;Development of an AR-Based AI Education App for Non-Majors(2022) IEEE Access, 10, pp. 14149-14156.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123676634&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3145355&partnerID=40&md5=639b47927ae0ca5f33a2e4ffdb5b98e0DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3145355ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to develop an AR-based app to teach non-engineering majors AI and analyze the educational effect.

The authors investigate how AI may influence the profession and provide examples of how ultrasound imaging may be enhanced and innovated by integrating AI technology. This article highlights challenges related to the application of AI and provides insight into how they could be addressed. The critical distinction between the role of a sonographer and the reporting specialist in the context of AI is highlighted as a key issue for those developing, researching, and evaluating AI systems. A key recommendation is for the sonography community to address ultrasound education, particularly how AI knowledge could be incorporated into university education.

The development of AI technology, in addition to demand and popularity of technological innovations, has given rise to a large number of AI-education companies, and e-learning is poised to enter the advanced stage. The activities in which it is beginning to be implemented are the assessment of users' achievement and provision of a live environment. In this study, a model of the willingness to continuously use AI-enabled language online e-learning products is constructed. The survey participants comprised users of online learning product in China and conclusions are drawn from the users' perspective through empirical analysis based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, combined with perceived risk and perceived entertainment variables. Therefore, based on a theoretical framework, suggestions are provided to optimise the design and marketing of AI-enabled e-learning products and leverage the users' experiences to satisfy their needs. According to the results, from the perspective of users, we propose suggestions for the sustainable development and optimisation of AI-enabled online education products and strategies to help operators reconcile the experiences and needs of the users. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

The review utilised the PRISMA framework to review the analysis and synthesis process encompassing the search, screening, coding, and data analysis strategy of 141 items included in the corpus. Key findings extracted from the review incorporate a taxonomy of artificial intelligence applications with associated teaching and learning practice and a framework for helping teachers to develop and self-reflect on the skills and capabilities envisioned for employing artificial intelligence in education. Implications for ethical use and a set of propositions for enacting teaching and learning using artificial intelligence are demarcated. The findings of this review contribute to developing a better understanding of how artificial intelligence may enhance teachers’ roles as catalysts in designing, visualising, and orchestrating AI-enabled teaching and learning, and this will, in turn, help to proliferate AI-systems that render computational representations based on meaningful data-driven inferences of the pedagogy, domain, and learner models. © 2021 by the authors.

These surveys usually comprise both the Likert scale and free-text responses. Since the discrete Likert scale responses are easy to analyze, they feature more prominently in survey analyses. However, the free-text responses often contain richer, detailed, and nuanced information with actionable insights. Mining these insights is more challenging, as it requires a higher degree of processing by human experts, making the process time-consuming and resource intensive. Consequently, the free-text analyses are often restricted in scale, scope, and impact. To address these issues, we propose a novel automated analysis framework for extracting actionable information from free-text responses to open-ended questions in student feedback questionnaires. By leveraging state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques and unsupervised clustering methods, we implemented our framework as a case study to analyze a large-scale dataset of 4400 open-ended responses to the National Student Survey (NSS) at a UK university. These analyses then led to the identification, design, implementation, and evaluation of a series of teaching and learning interventions over a two-year period. The highly encouraging results demonstrate our approach’s validity and broad (national and international) application potential—covering tertiary education, commercial training, and apprenticeship programs, etc., where textual feedback is collected to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. © 2022 by the authors.

Robotics curriculum system and teaching pattern related to AI also need to be innovated and reformed. In this case, we designed the robot software engineering course, which includes robotic core functions: navigation, vision, speech interaction and manipulator operation, etc. To accelerate novice learners to grasp the basic knowledge about AI, we developed the universal robotic platform based on ROS, and apply it to a variety of specific environments and scenarios. To investigate the effect of the proposed education method, we provided opportunities for the novice learners to attend the International RoboCup Competitions, and obtained not only the Champion but also a serial of remarkable achievements. © 2022, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Higher education;  Robot Operating System (ROS);  Robotics;  TurtlebotDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYu, Y., Kang, F., Duan, F.57363349600;57221519326;24537140100;An Online Aircraft Control Platform for the Online Artificial Intelligence Education(2022) Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 644 LNEE, pp. 3125-3133.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120609438&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-8155-7_261&partnerID=40&md5=a3c1916bced639f3645279c6f6e4f7e3DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-8155-7_261ABSTRACT: To solve the lack of artificial intelligence (AI) education platforms, an online aircraft control platform is designed in this paper. Compared with the traditional ways, our platform is cheaper and more intuitive, covers more theories, and is more interesting for students. This system is based on PX4, an open-source aircraft control framework. We emphasize three parts: 1. Estimation algorithms, applying AI theories to estimate the position and attitude of the aircraft by sensor data. 2. Control algorithms, using classic control theories, such as PID to control position and attitude. 3. simulator, which allows users to examine their works intuitively in a more safely and conveniently way. Leading the novice learners to study in this platform will make them have a better command of AI and control theories and raises their interest in studying in the future. © 2022, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Flight estimator;  PID control;  Teaching system;  Unmanned aircraftDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSchlippe, T., Sawatzki, J.42062203500;57351804600;AI-Based Multilingual Interactive Exam Preparation(2022) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 349 LNNS, pp. 396-408.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119864821&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-90677-1_38&partnerID=40&md5=ecb57b35a42db91e0c84bdbc4c5d7580DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-90677-1_38ABSTRACT: Our previous analysis on 26 languages which represent over 2.9 billion speakers and 8 language families demonstrated that cross-lingual automatic short answer grading allows students to write answers in exams in their native language and graders to rely on the scores of the system [1]. With lower deviations than 14% (0.72 points out of 5 points) on the corpus of the short answer grading data set of the University of North Texas [2], our natural language processing models show better performances compared to the human grader variability (0.75 points, 15%). In this paper we describe our latest analysis of the integration and application of a multilingual model in interactive training programs to optimally prepare students for exams. We present a multilingual interactive conversational artificial intelligence tutoring system for exam preparation. Our approach leverages and combines learning analytics, crowdsourcing and gamification to automatically allow us to evaluate and adapt the system as well as to motivate students and increase their learning experience. In order to have an optimal learning effect and enhance the user experience, we also tackle the challenge of explainability with the help of keyword extraction and highlighting techniques. Our system is based on Telegram since it can be easily integrated into massive open online courses and other online study systems and has already more than 400 million users worldwide [3]. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence in education;  Conversational AI;  Cross-lingual short answer grading;  Keyword extraction;  Natural language processingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusQuon, R.J., Meisenhelter, S., Camp, E.J., Testorf, M.E., Song, Y., Song, Q., Culler, G.W., Moein, P., Jobst, B.C.57210588006;57031900600;57220782735;7005491891;55494221000;57329292300;57614921300;55332421400;7004544528;AiED: Artificial intelligence for the detection of intracranial interictal epileptiform discharges(2022) Clinical Neurophysiology, 133, pp. 1-8.

We report results from an automated method consisting of a template-matching algorithm and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of intracranial IEDs (“AiED”). Methods: 1000 intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) epochs extracted randomly from 307 subjects with refractory epilepsy were annotated independently by two expert neurophysiologists. These annotated epochs were divided into 1062 two-second epochs with IEDs and 1428 two-second epochs without IEDs, which were transformed into spectrograms prior to training the neural network. The highest performing network was validated on an annotated external test set. Results: The final network had an F1-score of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91–0.98) and an average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96–1.00). For the external test set, it showed an overall F1-score of 0.71, correctly identifying 100% of all high-amplitude IED complexes, 96.23% of all high-amplitude isolated IEDs, and 66.15% of all IEDs of atypical morphology. Conclusions: Template-matching combined with a CNN offers a fast, robust method for detecting intracranial IEDs. Significance: “AiED” is generalizable and achieves comparable performance to human reviewers; it may support clinical and research EEG analyses. © 2021 International Federation of Clinical NeurophysiologyAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  CNN;  Deep learning;  EEG;  Epilepsy;  IED detection;  Interictal epileptiform dischargesDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusYuan, M.57282429800;Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Higher Education in the Internet Era(2022) Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies, 84, pp. 604-611.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116242642&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-5857-0_77&partnerID=40&md5=2c513ee1397882e7aac101b0abb89b74DOI: 10.1007/978-981-16-5857-0_77ABSTRACT: With the continuous development of science and technology and the wide application of AI technology, AI system based on computer platform is gradually introduced into the field of education.

For a counterpart study in the US, we examined the impact of AI on US medical students' choice of radiology as a career, and how such impact is influenced by students' opinions on and exposures to AI and radiology. Methods: Students across 32 US medical schools participated in an anonymous online survey. The respondents' radiology ranking with and without AI were compared. Among those considering radiology within their top 3 choices, change in radiology ranking due to AI was statistically examined for association with baseline characteristics, subjective opinions, and prior exposures. Results: AI significantly lowered students' preference for ranking radiology (P < .001). One-sixth of students who would have chosen radiology as the first choice did not do so because of AI, and approximately half of those considering radiology within their top 3 choices remained concerned about AI. Ranking radiology lower due to AI was associated with greater concerns about AI (P < .001), less perceived understanding of radiology (P = .02), predicting a decrease in job opportunities (P < .001), and exposure to AI through medical students/family (P = .03) as well as through radiology attendings and residents (P = .03). Education on AI during radiology rotations, followed by pre-clinical lectures, was the most preferred way to learn about AI. Conclusion: AI has a significantly negative impact on US medical students' choice of radiology as a career, a phenomenon influenced by both individual concerns and exposure to AI from the medical community. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Career choice;  Medical education;  RadiologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusGeorges, J., Magdi, D.57216900052;57191340920;COVID-19 Pandemic’s Impact on E-learning Platforms: A Survey(2022) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 224, pp. 253-264.

Many industries and organizations start to come up with alternative ways to accomplish tasks after the sudden lockdown either by splitting teams into smaller groups or by working from home (if this is applicable) according to the organization's policy. Like many other aspects of everyday life, COVID-19 had a serious impact on students, instructors, and all educational organizations worldwide. The pandemic caused schools, colleges and universities across the globe to shut down their campuses so that students could follow social distancing measures (Muhammad Adnan1and Kainat Anwar1, Online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Students perspectives, Journal of Pedagogical Research - June 2020). Because of the pandemic, many possible solutions and alternatives were suggested to solve the dilemma of the education system amidst the global pandemic (Christian Paul Chua, Lawrence Dale Valencia, The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Education Amidst of the COVID-19 Pandemic, conference paper, August 2020.). Schools and universities start to work online using open tools technologies to be able to deliver the course contents including the course objectives and the intended learning outcomes of each course. Many online educational platforms were available to use by universities. This paper discusses some of the educational platforms and the impact of COVID-19 on these platforms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: COVID-19;  Educational platforms;  Online learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusChang, C.-Y., Hwang, G.-J., Gau, M.-L.57195596036;57226126184;6701848435;Promoting students' learning achievement and self-efficacy: A mobile chatbot approach for nursing training(2022) British Journal of Educational Technology, 53 (1), pp. 171-188.

In prenatal education, cultivating nurses' knowledge and competence of vaccine administration is a crucial issue for protecting pregnant women and newborns from infection. Therefore, obstetric vaccination knowledge has become a basic and essential training program for nursing students. However, most of these training programs are given via the lecture-based teaching approach with skills practice, providing students with few opportunities to think deeply about the relevant issues owing to the lack of interaction and context. This could have a negative impact on their learning effectiveness and clinical judgment. To address this problem, a mobile chatbot-based learning approach is proposed in this study to enable students to learn and think deeply in the contexts of handling obstetric vaccine cases via interacting with the chatbot. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was implemented. Two classes of 36 students from a university in northern Taiwan were recruited as participants. One class was the experimental group learning with the proposed approach, while the other class was the control group learning with the conventional approach (ie, giving lectures to explain the instructional content and training cases). The results indicate that applying a mobile chatbot for learning can enhance nursing students' learning achievement and self-efficacy. In addition, based on the analysis of the interview results, students generally believed that learning through the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as their learning engagement and performance. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Issues relevant to AI technology in education have been extensively discussed and explored around the world. Among the various AI systems, the potential of chatbots has been highlighted by researchers owing to the user-friendly interface developed using the natural language processing (NLP) technology. Few studies using AI chatbots in professional training have been conducted. What this paper adds In this study, a mobile chatbot was used in a nursing training program to enhance students' learning achievement and self-efficacy for handling vaccine cases. The mobile chatbot significantly improved the students' learning achievement and self-efficacy in comparison with the conventional learning approach in the vaccine training program. From the interview results, it was found that the students generally believed that the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as learning engagement and performances in the vaccine training program. Implications for practice and/or policy Mobile chatbots have great potential for professional training owing to their convenient and user-friendly features. It would be worth applying mobile chatbots as well as other NLP-based applications to other professional training programs in the future. © 2021 British Educational Research AssociationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusAlnaqbi, A.M.A., Yassin, A.M.57557407100;36440735000;Current Status, Challenges and Strategies of Artificial Intelligence and E-learning the UAE Military Education System(2021) International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology, 12 (3), pp. 352-361.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127380664&doi=10.30880%2fijscet.2021.12.03.034&partnerID=40&md5=03c22fb1fd3960b05322da4ac975753cDOI: 10.30880/ijscet.2021.12.03.034ABSTRACT: Recently, UAE has adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) and e-learning system in several fields including education. Together with the institutions running on conventional educational system, military colleges have also embrassed this new technology. This study assessed the current status of adoption, challenges and strategies of using AI based e-learning system in the UAE military based colleges. The study was carried out based on the perception of the teachers and students of Joint Command and Staff College (JCSC). A set of the questions was presented to the 50 teachers and 157 students for highlighting the level of agreement for each question. The questions were devided into three sections as level of adoption, challenges, and strategies in using AI based e-learning education system. The study found that for current status, AI and e-learning have got siginificant popularity in the education system due to high level of flexibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and educational psychology theory are applied for designing a personalized online learning resource recommendation scheme to improve students' learning outcomes. First, according to educational psychology, students' learning ability can be obtained by analyzing their learning behaviors. Their identities can be classified into three main groups. Then, features of learning resources such as difficulty degree are extracted, and a LinUCB-based learning resource recommendation algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, a personalized exploration coefficient is carefully constructed according to student's ability and attention scores. It can adaptively adjust the ratio of exploration and exploitation during recommendation. Finally, experiments are conducted for evaluating the superior performance of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation scheme can find appropriate learning resources which will match the student's ability and satisfy the student's personalized demands. Meanwhile, by comparing with existing state-of-the-art recommendation schemes, the proposed scheme can achieve accurate recommendations, so as to provide students with the most suitable online learning resources and reduce the risk brought by exploration. Therefore, the proposed scheme can not only control the difficulty degree of learning resources within the student's ability but also encourage their potential by providing suitable learning resources.

Currently, teachers in most of the schools judge student' concentration only by their eyes subjectively. But this approach not only distracts teachers from the lesson but also difficult to obtain feedback on the result after class. In this paper, we introduce a method based on machine vision to evaluate students' concentration. We apply the YOLO algorithm on facial movement detection to predict whether students are engaged in class. It not only helps to differentiate instruction for students but also helps teachers to optimize their lessons. The experiments demonstrate that the method can achieve the assessment of students' concentration within a small-size classroom. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Machine Vision;  Object Detection;  Students' Concentration;  YOLO AlgorithmDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusManisha De Lile, C., Kumarawadu, P.57499250600;6506713095;A Comprehensive Investigation Supporting Educational Development of Special Needs Students through Personification and Emotion AI(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 8-14.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126592696&doi=10.1145%2f3510309.3510311&partnerID=40&md5=d9881e94fdc8e999ef42d7cce232aec7DOI: 10.1145/3510309.3510311ABSTRACT: This research is aimed at identifying a suitable approach for the unheeded challenges collated within the education structure of special needs students in Sri Lanka and explores methods of monitoring the progress, performance and development of special needs students in relation to the educational engagement in the special education system of Sri Lanka.

The application of AI in healthcare practice is more advanced than in healthcare education. The advancement of AI is unstoppable. Nursing educators need to have a good understanding of AI to equip nursing students with the requisite knowledge to meet the needs of the AI age. The purpose of this article is to briefly describe the history of AI in education, relevant AI concepts, current applications of AI in healthcare education, dilemmas, and recommendations for the future. AI is not invincible, and it is critical to prudently evaluate and consider the related data biases and ethical issues. Nursing educators should reflect on whether we are preparing students for yesterday’s job or for the future workforce. Nursing educators need to engage in curriculum reform and gain an understanding of critical AI concepts and applications to equip nursing students with the requisite information-technology capacities to meet the needs of the AI age. © 2021, Taiwan Nurses Association.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and vaccines against it could represent new environmental triggers for AIED. We report a patient, with history of vitiligo vulgaris and 8 years of type 2 diabetes, who came to our institution because of fever, weight loss, asthenia and thyrotoxicosis occurred 4 weeks later the administration of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Clinical, biochemical and instrumental work-up demonstrated Graves’ disease and autoimmune diabetes mellitus. The occurrence of these disorders could be explained through different mechanism such as autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome), mRNA “self-adjuvant” effect, molecular mimicry between human and viral proteins and immune disruption from external stimuli. However further studies are needed to better understand the underlying pathogenesis of AIED following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. © 2021 Elsevier LtdAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Graves' disease;  SARS-CoV-2;  Type 1 diabetes mellitus;  VaccineDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusZheng, B., Wu, M.-N., Zhu, S.-J., Zhou, H.-X., Hao, X.-L., Fei, F.-Q., Jia, Y., Wu, J., Yang, W.-H., Pan, X.-P.57202691724;57226823303;35118359700;57225956082;22634289100;57222188105;57289952000;57224882518;56070103200;57290830600;Attitudes of medical workers in China toward artificial intelligence in ophthalmology: a comparative survey(2021) BMC Health Services Research, 21 (1), art. no. 1067, .

This survey aims to assess medical workers’ and other professional technicians’ familiarity with, attitudes toward, and concerns about AI in ophthalmology. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study design study. An electronic questionnaire was designed through the app Questionnaire Star, and was sent to respondents through WeChat, China’s version of Facebook or WhatsApp. The participation was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire consisted of four parts, namely the respondents’ background, their basic understanding of AI, their attitudes toward AI, and their concerns about AI. A total of 562 respondents were counted, with 562 valid questionnaires returned. The results of the questionnaires are displayed in an Excel 2003 form. Results: There were 291 medical workers and 271 other professional technicians completed the questionnaire. About 1/3 of the respondents understood AI and ophthalmic AI. The percentages of people who understood ophthalmic AI among medical workers and other professional technicians were about 42.6 % and 15.6 %, respectively. About 66.0 % of the respondents thought that AI in ophthalmology would partly replace doctors, about 59.07 % having a relatively high acceptance level of ophthalmic AI. Meanwhile, among those with AI in ophthalmology application experiences (30.6 %), above 70 % of respondents held a full acceptance attitude toward AI in ophthalmology. The respondents expressed medical ethics concerns about AI in ophthalmology. And among the respondents who understood AI in ophthalmology, almost all the people said that there was a need to increase the study of medical ethics issues in the ophthalmic AI field. Conclusions: The survey results revealed that the medical workers had a higher understanding level of AI in ophthalmology than other professional technicians, making it necessary to popularize ophthalmic AI education among other professional technicians. Most of the respondents did not have any experience in ophthalmic AI but generally had a relatively high acceptance level of AI in ophthalmology, and there was a need to strengthen research into medical ethics issues. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Artificial intelligence in medicine;  Artificial intelligence in ophthalmology;  Doctor replacement;  Medical ethics;  Ophthalmic artificial intelligence;  Replacing doctorsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusPiotrkowicz, A., Wang, K., Hallam, J., Dimitrova, V.57194681359;57278442900;57189729029;56265365000;Data-driven Exploration of Engagement with Workplace-based Assessment in the Clinical Skills Domain(2021) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 31 (4), pp. 1022-1052.

Unlike formal university-based part of the degree, the setting of WBA can be informal and only loosely regulated, as students are encouraged to take every opportunity to learn from the clinical setting. For clinical educators and placement coordinators it is vital to follow and analyse students’ engagement with WBA while on placements, in order to understand how students are participating in the assessment, and what improvements can be made. We analyse digital data capturing the students’ WBA attempts and comments on how the assessments went, using process mining and text analytics. We compare Year 1 cohorts across three years, focusing on differences between primary vs. secondary care placements. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the exploration of computational approaches for multi-faceted, data-driven assessment analytics for workplace learning which includes:(i) a set of features for analysing clinical skills WBA data, (ii) analysis of the temporal aspects ofthat data using process mining, and (iii) utilising text analytics to compare student reflections on WBA. We show how assessment data captured during clinical placements can provide insights about the student engagement and inform the medical education practice. Our work is inspired by Jim Greer’s vision that intelligent methods and techniques should be adopted to address key challenges faced by educational practitioners in order to foster improvement of learning and teaching. In the broader AI in Education context, the paper shows the application of AI methods to address educational challenges in a new informal learning domain - practical healthcare placements in higher education medical training. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Medical Education;  Process Mining;  Text Analytics;  Workplace-based AssessmentDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusBanerjee, M., Chiew, D., Patel, K.T., Johns, I., Chappell, D., Linton, N., Cole, G.D., Francis, D.P., Szram, J., Ross, J., Zaman, S.57226705816;57226728339;56985072700;57204912237;57528928100;57207603130;36623430500;7401512763;57226717694;57226706910;55798249000;The impact of artificial intelligence on clinical education: perceptions of postgraduate trainee doctors in London (UK) and recommendations for trainers(2021) BMC Medical Education, 21 (1), art. no. 429, .

Although there is robust evidence that AI innovations can improve patient care, reduce clinicians’ workload and increase efficiency, their impact on medical training and education remains unclear. Methods: A survey of trainee doctors’ perceived impact of AI technologies on clinical training and education was conducted at UK NHS postgraduate centers in London between October and December 2020. Impact assessment mirrored domains in training curricula such as ‘clinical judgement’, ‘practical skills’ and ‘research and quality improvement skills’. Significance between Likert-type data was analysed using Fisher’s exact test. Response variations between clinical specialities were analysed using k-modes clustering. Free-text responses were analysed by thematic analysis. Results: Two hundred ten doctors responded to the survey (response rate 72%). The majority (58%) perceived an overall positive impact of AI technologies on their training and education. Respondents agreed that AI would reduce clinical workload (62%) and improve research and audit training (68%). Trainees were skeptical that it would improve clinical judgement (46% agree, p = 0.12) and practical skills training (32% agree, p < 0.01). The majority reported insufficient AI training in their current curricula (92%), and supported having more formal AI training (81%). Conclusions: Trainee doctors have an overall positive perception of AI technologies’ impact on clinical training. There is optimism that it will improve ‘research and quality improvement’ skills and facilitate ‘curriculum mapping’. There is skepticism that it may reduce educational opportunities to develop ‘clinical judgement’ and ‘practical skills’. Medical educators should be mindful that these domains are protected as AI develops. We recommend that ‘Applied AI’ topics are formalized in curricula and digital technologies leveraged to deliver clinical education. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Clinical training;  Machine learning;  Medical educationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusAntwi, W.K., Akudjedu, T.N., Botwe, B.O.55232460700;57200614936;23977784400;Artificial intelligence in medical imaging practice in Africa: a qualitative content analysis study of radiographers’ perspectives(2021) Insights into Imaging, 12 (1), art. no. 80, .

This study aimed to qualitatively explore the perception of radiographers relating to the integration of AI in medical imaging practice in Africa. Methods: The study employed a qualitative design using an open-ended online instrument administered between March and August 2020. Participants consisted of radiographers working within Africa during the time of the study. Data obtained were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Six themes of concerns were generated: expectant tool; career insecurity; cost of new technology, equipment preservation and data insecurity; service delivery quality; need for expanding AI awareness. Results: A total of 475 valid responses were obtained. Participants demonstrated a positive outlook about AI in relation to clinical quality improvement, competent diagnosis, radiation dose reduction and improvement in research. They however expressed concerns relating to the implementation of this technology, including job security and loss of core professional radiographer skills and roles. In addition, concerns regarding AI equipment maintenance, lack of awareness about AI and education and training opportunities were evident. Conclusion: Awareness of the importance of AI in medical imaging practice was acknowledged; however, concerns relating to job security, data protection must be given critical attention for successful implementation of these advanced technologies in medical imaging in Africa. Inclusion of AI modules in the training of future radiographers is highly recommended. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Africa;  Artificial intelligence;  Medical imaging;  Online surveys;  Qualitative study;  RadiographyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusCox, A.M.7402563906;Exploring the impact of Artificial Intelligence and robots on higher education through literature-based design fictions(2021) International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 18 (1), art. no. 3, .

The scope of this impact is hard to grasp partly because the literature is siloed, as well as the changing meaning of the concepts themselves. But developments are surrounded by controversies in terms of what is technically possible, what is practical to implement and what is desirable, pedagogically or for the good of society. Design fictions that vividly imagine future scenarios of AI or robotics in use offer a means both to explain and query the technological possibilities. The paper describes the use of a wide-ranging narrative literature review to develop eight such design fictions that capture the range of potential use of AI and robots in learning, administration and research. They prompt wider discussion by instantiating such issues as how they might enable teaching of high order skills or change staff roles, as well as exploring the impact on human agency and the nature of datafication. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  AIEd;  Artificial Intelligence;  Big data;  Design fiction;  Learning analytics;  Robots;  Social robotsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusYan, H., Lin, F., Kinshuk57202432985;7402777367;57223812851;Including Learning Analytics in the Loop of Self-Paced Online Course Learning Design(2021) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 31 (4), pp. 878-895.

Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer’s work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop. Finally, future work on how to develop and evaluate learning analytics enabled learning systems is outlined. © 2020, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AIED;  Course learning design;  Intervention;  Learning analytics;  Learning data;  Self-paced online learning;  Student modellingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusLindqwister, A.L., Hassanpour, S., Lewis, P.J., Sin, J.M.57219422223;56835377400;7402869091;57214890115;AI-RADS: An Artificial Intelligence Curriculum for Residents(2021) Academic Radiology, 28 (12), pp. 1810-1816.

A PubMed search for the terms “artificial intelligence radiology” demonstrates an exponential increase in publications on this topic in recent years. Despite these impending changes, medical education designed for future radiologists have only recently begun. We present our institution's efforts to address this problem as a model for a successful introductory curriculum into artificial intelligence in radiology titled AI-RADS. Materials and Methods: The course was based on a sequence of foundational algorithms in AI; these algorithms were presented as logical extensions of each other and were introduced as familiar examples (spam filters, movie recommendations, etc.). Since most trainees enter residency without computational backgrounds, secondary lessons, such as pixel mathematics, were integrated in this progression. Didactic sessions were reinforced with a concurrent journal club highlighting the algorithm discussed in the previous lecture. To circumvent often intimidating technical descriptions, study guides for these papers were produced. Questionnaires were administered before and after each lecture to assess confidence in the material. Surveys were also submitted at each journal club assessing learner preparedness and appropriateness of the article. Results: The course received a 9.8/10 rating from residents for overall satisfaction. With the exception of the final lecture, there were significant increases in learner confidence in reading journal articles on AI after each lecture. Residents demonstrated significant increases in perceived understanding of foundational concepts in artificial intelligence across all mastery questions for every lecture.

The use of AI in science teacher training programs is something that rarely done, especially in integrated science learning. The purpose of this study was to mapping the competencies of science teachers after receive pedagogical suggestions based on AI. This activity was attended by 20 science teachers in West Java who are members of the teacher training program. The competency patterns of science teachers were analyzed descriptively qualitatively in order to see the combination of knowledge between AI and natural knowledge of science teachers. The results show some teachers made innovative integrated science learning and teachers were able to follow, modify, or ignore pedagogical suggestions. These results also provide a field evaluation of the development of an integrated science learning program assisted by AI. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Specifically, we discuss iterative work to improve the design of a pedagogical agent in the Betty’s Brain learning environment, Mr. Davis. Students interacted with the pedagogical agent in Betty’s Brain during two separate studies, two months apart. During study one, qualitative interviews were prompted by student actions within the system and theoretically aligned sequences of educationally relevant affective states (as detected by previously validated models). Facilitaed by an app called the Quick Red Fox (QRF), these in situ interviews were then used to identify ways to rapidly improve Mr. Davis’ design, investigated in study two. Results indicate that changes designed to make Mr. Davis more empathetic correlate with improved learning outcomes. We also discuss the potential for rapidly collected qualitative data in future developments. © 2021 29th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2021 - Proceedings.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing attention in different educational sectors in the digital era. STEM education targets at cultivating students' creative mindset and cross-disciplinary ability to create artifacts that solve problems of humankind and serve human needs. AI targets at solving problems together with computers for automating parts of the problem-solving processes in a manner comparable with humans' processes. This panel will provide a platform for sharing an international perspective with panelists from different countries about the role of AI in STEM education. The discussion will focus on three directions: (1) the role of STEM activities in promoting students to effectively develop AI literacy; (2) the role of AI elements in promoting students to develop STEM knowledge with fun; and (3) the synergy between AI elements and STEM activities for closely linking up students' school learning with daily life, especially through applying AI literacy in the design of STEM artifacts.

Students can use a small private online course (SPOC) teaching platform to preview class-related materials, learn basic knowledge, and enhance the practical experience of system development in offline courses. The research team applied an artificial intelligence (AI) precision education strategy to design a teaching experiment that evaluated whether this approach may lead to better learning outcomes. In addition to questionnaire surveys to ascertain students' attitudes toward and their satisfaction with learning, this study employed in-depth interviews to understand a potential influence on changes in teachers' curriculum design and teaching approaches when SPOCs was integrated into the traditional university classroom, as well as the impact of the AI precision education model. The results showed that the AI precision education model may facilitate students' learning experience and enhance student achievement.

The researcher employed a descriptive and analytical approach. A questionnaire was used to measure the impact of AI and e-learning on four different themes related to education in Saudi Arabia. The data from 406 respondents suggested a statistically significant (α≤ 0.05) effect of AI on e-learning. The faculty members strongly agreed that AI and e-learning improved relevant aims of teaching and related practices during the pandemic. Moreover, the influence on practices related to teaching methods during the pandemic was also highly positive. Further, the instructors strongly acknowledged that e-learning and AI ameliorated their teaching practices in general. Finally, the study depicted that e-learning and AI assisted instructors to automate grading and evaluation, ensures the confidentiality of data, and provides easier access to information. The average of the sample responses for all four fields analyzed in the study corresponded to the degree of approval. This study has a paramount importance due to the continuity of education in the context of the COVID19 pandemic and the role of e-learning and artificial intelligence in education in general. © 2021 Conscientia Beam.

Challenging the idea that AI is a break from previous capitalist technologies, the book offers nuanced examination of the impacts of AI on the control and regulation of academic work and labour, on digital learning and remote teaching, and on the value of learning and knowledge. Applying a Marxist perspective, Preston argues that commodity fetishism, surveillance, and increasing productivity ushered in by the growth of AI, further alienates and exploits academic labour and commodifies learning and research. The text puts forward a solid theoretical framework and methodology for thinking about AI to inform critical and revolutionary pedagogies. Offering an impactful and timely analysis, this book provides a critical engagement and application of key Marxist concepts in the study of AI’s role in Higher Education.

IEQ in classrooms impacts the comfort, health, and productivity of students as well as teachers. This article systematically discusses IEQ parameters related to studies conducted in Indian school classrooms during the last fifteen years. Real-time research studies conducted on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), Thermal Comfort (TC), Acoustic Comfort (AcC), and Visual Comfort (VC) in Indian school classrooms from July 2006 to March 2021 are considered to gain insight into the existing research methodologies. This review article indicates that IEQ parameter studies in Indian school buildings are tortuous, strewn, inadequate, and unorganized. There is no literature review available on studies conducted on IEQ parameters in Indian school classrooms. The results infer that in India, there is no well-established method to assess the indoor environmental condition of classrooms in school buildings to date. Indian school classrooms are bleak and in dire need of energy-efficient modifications that maintain good IEQ for better teaching and learning outcomes. The prevailing COVID-19 Pandemic, Artificial Intelligence (AI), National Education Policy (NEP), Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Green Schools (GS) are also discussed to effectively link existing conditions with the future of IEQ research in Indian school classrooms. © 2021 by the authors.

However, AI education has yet to catch up with the challenge of introducing this complex and very important area of technology to audiences beyond the students of computing and engineering disciplines. This is not surprising, given the lack of materials for and experience in teaching AI for non-technical audiences. In this paper we present the challenges in developing an AI course in business schools and propose a curriculum for a graduate-level business course in AI, which balances AI fundamentals with the latest developments in the field. We discuss our choices and present the results of a study, examining students’ experiences, learning outcomes, and perceptions regarding the course. We offer practical guidelines for the curriculum design that other educators may adopt in designing their AI training courses. © 2021AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI-Ready workforce;  Artificial intelligence;  Business curricula;  Curriculum design;  Learning outcomesDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMalamateniou, C., McFadden, S., McQuinlan, Y., England, A., Woznitza, N., Goldsworthy, S., Currie, C., Skelton, E., Chu, K.-Y., Alware, N., Matthews, P., Hawkesford, R., Tucker, R., Town, W., Matthew, J., Kalinka, C., O'Regan, T.6504492094;7005942942;57226086273;8864134200;56025827500;54415750100;57227724100;56035771700;55669470400;57226994600;57228273600;57226994700;57228273700;57227906300;57192071101;57224080853;57209823910;Artificial Intelligence: Guidance for clinical imaging and therapeutic radiography professionals, a summary by the Society of Radiographers AI working group(2021) Radiography, 27 (4), pp. 1192-1202.

The aim of the document is to provide baseline guidance for radiographers working in the field of AI in education, research, clinical practice and stakeholder partnerships. The guideline is intended for use by the multi-professional clinical imaging and radiotherapy teams, including all staff, volunteers, students and learners. Methods: The format mirrored similar publications from other SCoR working groups in the past. The recommendations have been subject to a rapid period of peer, professional and patient assessment and review. Feedback was sought from a range of SoR members and advisory groups, as well as from the SoR director of professional policy, as well as from external experts. Amendments were then made in line with feedback received and a final consensus was reached. Results: AI is an innovative tool radiographers will need to engage with to ensure a safe and efficient clinical service in imaging and radiotherapy. Educational provisions will need to be proportionately adjusted by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer the necessary knowledge, skills and competences for diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers, to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be central to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. Radiography-led research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable radiographers co-design, implement and validate AI solutions. Partnerships are key in ensuring the contribution of radiographers is integrated into healthcare AI ecosystems for the benefit of the patients and service users. Conclusion: Radiography is starting to work towards a future with AI-enabled healthcare. This guidance offers some recommendations for different areas of radiography practice. There is a need to update our educational curricula, rethink our research priorities, forge new strong clinical-academic-industry partnerships to optimise clinical practice. Specific recommendations in relation to clinical practice, education, research and the forging of partnerships with key stakeholders are discussed, with potential impact on policy and practice in all these domains. These recommendations aim to serve as baseline guidance for UK radiographers. Implications for practice: This review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners, researchers, academics and service users of clinical imaging and therapeutic radiography services. Radiography practice, education and research must gradually adjust to AI-enabled healthcare systems to ensure gains of AI technologies are maximised and challenges and risks are minimised. This guidance will need to be updated regularly given the fast-changing pace of AI development and innovation. © 2021AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Guidance;  Machine learning;  Radiographer;  RecommendationsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusDas, B., Sekh, A.A., Majumder, M., Phadikar, S.57195314718;57220090017;54788156300;26638877000;Can deep learning solve a preschool image understanding problem?(2021) Neural Computing and Applications, 33 (21), pp. 14401-14411.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105859473&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-021-06080-w&partnerID=40&md5=64a24c42d4ee73b0732b40f9129c7e06DOI: 10.1007/s00521-021-06080-wABSTRACT: Automatic assessment of learning is a process where the computer system automatically generates test items and evaluates the responses.

Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs. Methods: Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority (n = 855, 82%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader (n = 829, 78%) and work-flow optimization (n = 802, 77%). Ethical and legal issues (n = 630, 62%) and lack of knowledge (n = 584, 57%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority (n = 819, 79%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found (n = 241, 23%). Conclusions: Broad community demand exists for incorporation of AI into residency programs. Based on the results of the current study, integration of AI education seems advisable for radiology residents, including issues related to data management, ethics, and legislation. Key Points: • There is broad demand from the radiological community to incorporate AI into residency programs, but there is less support to recognize imaging informatics as a radiological subspecialty. • Ethical and legal issues and lack of knowledge are recognized as major bottlenecks for AI implementation by the radiological community, while the shortage in labeled data and IT-infrastructure issues are less often recognized as hurdles. • Integrating AI education in radiology curricula including technical aspects of data management, risk of bias, and ethical and legal issues may aid successful integration of AI into diagnostic radiology. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Diagnostic imaging;  Radiology;  Surveys and questionnairesDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusMouta, A., Pinto Llorente, A.M., Torrecilla Sánchez, E.M.57211945974;56669693100;56423687200;Blending machines, learning, sense of agency, and ethics: Designing an in-depth framework with Experts using the Delphi Method approach(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 665-670.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122103266&doi=10.1145%2f3486011.3486545&partnerID=40&md5=f0e2fe8cd81e5fa49b2b43a80b012cffDOI: 10.1145/3486011.3486545ABSTRACT: The latest technological advancements emerging as daily commodities are so far-reaching that our ways of thinking, feeling, acting, and relate to others may be transformed at a very silent and fast pace. Even if we restrict the context to Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd), what once were just fictional displays are rapidly becoming a reality. But which society layers and ethical frameworks are being considered in the process of conceiving AIEd scope? Given this context, this research aims at exploring ethical challenges of AIEd in terms of sense of agency development across formal education. It uses a mixed method approach, starting with an expert consultation though the Delphi Method. The results of its iterations are presented in this paper. Further on, its conclusions will enable the implementation of a focus group with teachers that will be the basis for the selection of a syllabus for an eLearning course on AIEd. The final insights of this research are expected to mainly reinforce understanding on AI applied to Education, contributing to the public interest, debate, understanding, and further research on AIEd, through the development of theoretical frameworks to analyze and incorporate its critical dimensions into deliberate pedagogical practices.

I say there was a failure to understand the role of technology in the growing commodification and managerialism in education. I point to the links between MOOCs, Open Educational Resources and Open Education and PLEs. I point to a contradiction between commodification and managerialism, with increasingly standardized curricula and credentials and the flourishing of opportunities for learning especially for adults. I say progress in researching, developing and implementing PLEs has to be viewed within the context of the wider development of educational technology and of the education and training system as a whole. Indeed, even this may be too narrow a perspective: one ambition for PLEs has been to support learning outside the formal education system and outside the classroom. I look at the growing use of Learning Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in education and consider how this might support PLEs. Finally, I refer to Neil Selwyn's idea of Ed-Tech Within Limits' which would foreground the need to plan future education technology use with a primary aim of 'coping with finiteness'"and "seek to re-establish technology use in education as a shared and communal activity"as a response to the climate crisis. I suggest this could provide a point of reference for us to rethink Personal Learning Environment encompassing the ideas of equity and encompassing both radical pedagogies and the perspectives of previously marginalized interests and non-powerful groups. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: agency in education;  equity in education;  MOOCs;  Open Education;  Personal Learning Environments;  PLEsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSingla, Y.K., Gupta, A., Bagga, S., Chen, C., Krishnamurthy, B., Shah, R.R.57204977681;57271617500;57271160700;25624426900;57196672802;56121902800;Speaker-Conditioned Hierarchical Modeling for Automated Speech Scoring(2021) International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings, pp. 1681-1691.

ASS systems face many challenges like open grammar, variable pronunciations, and unstructured or semi-structured content. Recent deep learning approaches have shown some promise in this domain. However, most of these approaches focus on extracting features from single audio, making them suffer from the lack of speaker-specific context required to model such a complex task. We propose a novel deep learning technique for non-native ASS, called speaker-conditioned hierarchical modelling. In our technique, we take advantage of the fact that oral proficiency tests rate multiple responses for a candidate. We extract context vectors from these responses and feed them as additional speaker-specific context to our network to score a particular response. We compare our technique with strong baselines and find that such modelling improves the model's average performance by 6.92% (maximum = 12.86%, minimum = 4.51%). We further show both quantitative and qualitative insights into the importance of this additional context in solving the problem of ASS. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: ai in education;  automated speech scoring;  end-to-end neural networks;  hierarchical modeling;  interpretability in ai;  multi-modal deep learning;  spontaneous speechDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusWu, S., Li, X., Zhu, S., Shen, W., Wu, J., Sun, Y.57536300100;57538763900;57537524800;57682126200;57536705400;57536300200;Application of Artificial Intelligence in Teaching Reform of New Economics(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 572-577.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126725216&doi=10.1145%2f3495018.3495121&partnerID=40&md5=4db2b83cfcdf08f7ab00045675c1dd99DOI: 10.1145/3495018.3495121ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence covers the knowledge of philosophy, mathematics, computer, control, neurology, economics and linguistics, and involves the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, edge computing, etc. Among them, the Internet of Things is an important application scenario of agents, and the building of the Internet of Things scenario can fully promote the application of agents. The application of artificial intelligence in education mainly includes two aspects: (1) teaching artificial intelligence by offering courses such as robotics, programming and machine learning, or by using logic thinking related to artificial intelligence to solve problems; (2) leading the systematic reform of education, such as intelligent perception, intelligent educational evaluation, intelligent recommendation of digital educational resources, and personalized learning. The application of artificial intelligence technology in MICE teaching is realized by introducing seven key technologies such as machine learning, knowledge map, natural language processing, humancomputer interaction, computer vision, biometric identification and AR/VR in teaching activities. Moreover, the introduction of artificial intelligence into the field of education can promote the development and supply of intelligent systems and tools, such as intelligent learning systems, virtual and real learning environments, intelligent education assistants, and the construction of an intelligent education environment. At present, artificial intelligence education products are rapidly entering schools and classrooms, which provides support for teachers to use artificial intelligence technology to achieve teaching innovation. In this paper, artificial intelligence technology is used as a means to put forward the application strategy of artificial intelligence in the new finance and economics education by studying the new finance and economics MICE major of Hebei University of Economics and Business. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Convention and MICE;  Human-machine interaction;  Machine learning;  New financial and economic education reformDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLuo, K., Jiang, G., Li, S., Bao, Z., Zhao, S., Li, Y., Shan, L., Zhang, L.57222227709;57537058400;57537881700;57538295600;57536247000;57215323897;54917806700;57218522609;Policy Optimization Recommendation Algorithm Based on Mapping Network for Behavior Enhancement(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 1877-1881.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126688276&doi=10.1145%2f3495018.3495506&partnerID=40&md5=6dce1f5c1f6053c4b164bdd55accc9ceDOI: 10.1145/3495018.3495506ABSTRACT: The algorithm of policy optimization with learning behavior enhancement based on mapping network technology was proposed, aiming to address the issues of lack and sparsity of learning behavior data and weak generalization ability of the model in AI education.

Colleges and universities (CU) have initially established a training model for accounting professionals (APS) in line with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, problems in the training of accounting talents (AT) have also emerged. How the talents trained in the accounting profession can better satisfy the needs of social development, especially the needs of corporate development, has not been solved very effectively for a long time. At present, the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on education is deepening, and artificial intelligence technology (AIT) is also promoting the transformation of talent training in CU. This article mainly uses questionnaire survey method and data analysis method to study the transformation and practice of accounting professional (AP) training in CU, and is intended to explore the transformation of AP training in CU under the blessing of AIT. Analyzed the opinions of college accounting students on the AP curriculum, and the practical teaching content that they think needs to be strengthened in professional learning. According to the survey results, most interviewees believe that there are problems with the curriculum, too many theoretical classes and fewer practical classes; practical teaching content that needs to be strengthened includes comprehensive training and practical production internships in the school, paying more attention to their own knowledge and practical ability to meet the needs of work. Therefore, the transformation of the training of APS in CU is an inevitable trend. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Accounting Major;  Artificial Intelligence Technology;  Talent Training;  Transformation PracticeDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYu, B.57330747600;Research on artificial intelligence technology in English teaching(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, art. no. 3501583, pp. 967-971.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122695963&doi=10.1145%2f3501409.3501583&partnerID=40&md5=006e0a02c387b3f7f7d2c86e9cf1a23fDOI: 10.1145/3501409.3501583ABSTRACT: Under the influence of AI technology, intelligent English education products continue to emerge.

While recent advances in machine learning techniques allow us to develop formal theories of conversational development in real-life contexts, progress has been slowed down by the lack of corpora that both approximate naturalistic interaction and provide clear access to children's non-verbal behavior in face-to-face conversations. This work is an effort to fill this gap. We introduce ChiCo (for Child Conversation), a corpus we built using an online video chat system. Using a weakly structured task (a word-guessing game), we recorded 20 conversations involving either children in middle childhood (i.e., 6 to 12 years old) interacting with their caregivers (condition of interest) or the same caregivers interacting with other adults (a control condition), resulting in 40 individual recordings. Our annotation of these videos has shown that the frequency of children's use of gaze, gesture and facial expressions mirrors that of adults. Future modeling research can capitalize on this rich behavioral data to study how both verbal and non-verbal cues contribute to the development of conversational coordination. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: child development;  conversation;  corpus;  multimodal;  non-verbal communicationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusChikobava, M., Romeike, R.57217584024;24475498800;Towards an Operationalization of AI acceptance among Pre-service Teachers(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118877363&doi=10.1145%2f3481312.3481349&partnerID=40&md5=b1818aa04d427bcefeefa5fd09915a2aDOI: 10.1145/3481312.3481349ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its popularity in many fields of our life, ranging from song recommendation to lung cancer identification. CSE can impart AI knowledge to all people (including teachers) so that they can make an informed decision about AI. Besides, AI technologies can support tailoring the education to the students' needs or unload teachers by doing routine work for them and leaving more space for creativity. However, despite the growing potential of AI applications in education, some skepticism or even rejection can be observed. It could be especially critical for teacher education: by being a role model for pupils, teachers could multiply their attitude towards AI while transferring it to the pupils. Although AI acceptance is broadly investigated in the marketing context, there is not much prior research on AI acceptance among teachers. Besides, AI acceptance as a term is questionable due to the heterogeneity of the AI field. We highlight the research gap, propose an instrument for the data collection, and introduce the idea of the acceptance spectrum. The proposed concept is exemplified by the case study of acceptance of the AI-supported homework assessment among pre-service teachers. © 2021 Owner/Author.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence (AI) acceptance;  Artificial Intelligence (AI) education;  Computer Science Education (CSE)DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLong, D., Blunt, T., Magerko, B.57195131855;57192850761;6506227997;Co-Designing AI Literacy Exhibits for Informal Learning Spaces(2021) Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 5 (CSCW2), art. no. 293, .

Informal learning spaces like museums are particularly well-suited for such public science communication efforts, but there is little research investigating how to design AI learning experiences for these spaces. This paper explores how to design museum experiences that communicate key concepts about AI, using collaboration, creativity, and embodiment as inspirations for design. We present the design of five low-fidelity AI literacy exhibit prototypes and results from a thematic analysis of participant interactions during a co-design workshop in which family groups interacted with the prototypes and designed exhibits of their own. Our findings suggest new topics and design considerations for AI-related exhibits and directions for future research. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  AI literacy;  co-creativity;  co-design;  collaboration;  creativity;  embodiment;  informal learning;  participatory designDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusGriggs, D.M., Crain-Dorough, M.57221746973;56111284000;Appreciative inquiry's potential in program evaluation and research(2021) Qualitative Research Journal, 21 (4), pp. 375-393.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100047285&doi=10.1108%2fQRJ-06-2020-0059&partnerID=40&md5=887df882684cdb3e1fbef81652e1420eDOI: 10.1108/QRJ-06-2020-0059ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purposes of this paper are to provide a description of AI and to document and compare two applications of AI, one in program evaluation and another in an applied research study. Design/methodology/approach: Focus groups, interviews and observations were used to gather rich qualitative data which was used to detail Appreciative Inquiry's value in evaluation and research. Findings: AI aided the researcher in connecting with the participants and valuing what they shared. In both studies, the use of AI amassed information that answered the research questions, provided a rich description of the context and findings, and led to data saturation. The authors describe and compare experiences with two applications of AI: program evaluation and a research study. This paper contributes further understanding of the use of AI in public education institutions. The researchers also explore the efficacy of using AI in qualitative research and recommend its use for multiple purposes. Research limitations/implications: Limitations occurred in the AI-Design Stage by using a positive viewpoint and because both program and partnership studied were new with limited data to use for designing a better future. So, the authors recommend a revisit of both studies through the same 4D Model. Practical implications: This manuscript shows that AI is useful for evaluation and research. It amplifies the participants' voices through favorite stories and successes. AI has many undiscovered uses. Social implications: Through the use of AI the authors can: improve theoretical perspectives; conduct research that yields more authentic data; enable participants to deeply reflect on their practice and feel empowered; and ultimately impact and improve the world. Originality/value: AI is presented as an evaluation tool for a high-school program and as a research approach identifying strengths and perceptions of an educational partnership. In both studies, AI crumbled the walls that are often erected by interviewees when expecting to justify or defend decisions and actions. This paper contributes further understanding of the use of AI in public education institutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI and program evaluation;  AI as a research tool;  Appreciative inquiry;  Qualitative researchDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusDwivedi, U., Gandhi, J., Parikh, R., Coenraad, M., Bonsignore, E., Kacorri, H.57510364300;57289006100;57289341700;57209799457;35190145700;35487798800;Exploring Machine Teaching with Children(2021) Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing, VL/HCC, 2010-October, .

The ubiquity of AI has led to an increasing demand to integrate AI learning experiences into K-12 education. Early learning experiences incorporating AI concepts and practices are critical for students to better understand, evaluate, and utilize AI technologies. AI planning is an important class of AI technologies in which an AI-driven agent utilizes the structure of a problem to construct plans of actions to perform a task. Although a growing number of efforts have explored promoting AI education for K-12 learners, limited work has investigated effective and engaging approaches for delivering AI learning experiences to elementary students. In this paper, we propose a visual interface to enable upper elementary students (grades 3-5, ages 8-11) to formulate AI planning tasks within a game-based learning environment. We present our approach to designing the visual interface as well as how the AI planning tasks are embedded within narrative-centered gameplay structured around a Use-Modify-Create scaffolding progression. Further, we present results from a qualitative study of upper elementary students using the visual interface. We discuss how the Use-Modify-Create approach supported student learning as well as discuss the misconceptions and usability issues students encountered while using the visual interface to formulate AI planning tasks. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence education for K-12;  Game-based learning;  Visual interfaceDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHuang, C., Samek, T., Shiri, A.57434878900;7801657096;6603401355;AI and Ethics: Ethical and Educational Perspectives for LIS(2021) Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, 62 (4), pp. 351-365.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123850115&doi=10.3138%2fjelis-62-4-2020-0106&partnerID=40&md5=33f150ab90ccbd1f3938aaef0ba42902DOI: 10.3138/jelis-62-4-2020-0106ABSTRACT: The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has affected higher education in a dramatic way, shifting the norms of teaching and learning.

Diagnostic Radiographers (DRs) and Radiation Therapists (RTTs) are at the forefront of this technological leap, thus an understanding of their views, in particular changes to their current roles, is key to safe, optimal implementation. Methods: An online survey was designed, including themes: role changes, clinical priorities for AI, patient benefits, and education. It was distributed nationally in the Republic of Ireland via the national professional body, clinical management, and social media. Results: 318 DRs and 77 RTTs participated. Priority areas for development included quality assurance, clinical audit, radiation dose optimisation, and improved workflow for DRs and treatment planning algorithm optimisation, clinical audit, and post processing for RTTs. There was resistance regarding AI use for patient facing roles and final image interpretation. 27.6% of DRs and 40.3% of RTTs currently use AI clinically and 46.1% of DRs and 41.2% of RTTs anticipate reduced staffing levels with AI. 64.9% of DRs and 70.6% of RTTs felt AI will be positive for patients, with the majority promoting AI regulation through national legislation. 86.1% of DRs and 94.0% of RTTs were favourable to AI implementation. Conclusion: This research identifies priority AI development and implementation areas for DRs and RTTs. It thus highlights that DRs and RTTs should be involved in development of AI tools that would best support practice, and that clearly defined pathways for AI implementation into these key professions requires discussion so that optimum use and patient safety can ensue. Implications for practice: Understanding opinions of AI has significant implications for practice, for ensuring optimal product development, implementation, and training, together with planning for potential DR and RTT role changes. © 2021 The College of RadiographersAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Education;  Medical imaging;  Professional issues;  Radiation therapists;  RadiographersDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusAlshaikh, F., Hewahi, N.57347012800;6508289260;AI and Machine Learning Techniques in the Development of Intelligent Tutoring System: A Review(2021) 2021 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies, 3ICT 2021, pp. 403-410.

ITS is one application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education. It provides a smart learning environment for students without intervention from the teacher. ITS's primary goal is to support and help learners obtain domain-specific intellectual knowledge in a practical and productive manner through the use of different computing technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive survey for previous research on ITS that utilize various techniques of AI and Machine Learning (ML). It gives an overview of ITS, its architecture, and some existing ITS examples. In addition, it highlights and summarizes the current research efforts and obstacles to ITS using AI, as well as some future opportunities. This study shows the importance of AI and ML in ITS development. It is noticed that researchers focus more on Reinforcement Learning (RL), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), clustering, Bayesian Network (BN) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) approaches. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Artificial Neural Networks;  Bayesian network;  Intelligent Tutoring System;  ITS;  Machine Learning;  Reinforcement LearningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusJiang, M.57361658900;The influence and research of online ai education system on preschool music education in higher vocational colleges(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 1118-1121.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120527457&doi=10.1145%2f3482632.3483095&partnerID=40&md5=fecb92726890c11b6ee3548d7ebee465DOI: 10.1145/3482632.3483095ABSTRACT: In the new era, people from all walks of life are paying more and more attention to the preschool music education major in higher vocational colleges. Especially in the context of the continuous improvement of the level of information technology, pre-school music education needs to be reformed accordingly to improve the overall teaching level.

Japan too imposed emergency remote teaching and learning at both the school and university level. In this study, we focus on a national university in Japan, and investigate how teaching and learning were facilitated during this pandemic period using an e-book platform, BookRoll. BookRoll was linked as an external tool to the university’s learning management system. Such an endeavor also reinforced the Japanese national thrust regarding explorations of e-book-based technologies and using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education. Teachers could upload reading materials, for instance their course notes, and associate an audio of their lecture. When students who registered in their courses accessed the learning materials, the system collected their interaction logs in a learning record store. Across the spring semesters from April to July 2020, the BookRoll system collected nearly 1.5 million reading interaction logs from more than 6,300 students across 243 courses in six domains with above 1,900 learners creating more than 78,000 reading logs weekly. While science and engineering courses mainly used the platform, law and language studies courses utilized the feature to upload audio tracks with reading materials. The interaction log analysis of the students with the content revealed that active learning actions, such as the use of annotations on text, were done more in humanities courses. Lastly, recommendations are created based on the analysis and the perception of the teachers about the emergency remote teaching and learning using the BookRoll system for orchestrating their course. © 2021, Canadian Network for Innovation in Education.

To realize this potential, however, it is imperative that civil servants have the necessary knowledge to recognise and optimally exploit the application and utilisation possibilities of AI. Massive open online courses (MOOC) are a promising way to help civil servants gain that required knowledge. But how can such a course be designed to become accepted by this target group? In this paper, we present a human-centered development approach to develop a MOOC about AI for civil servants. Using an analysis of the target audience's mental models, knowledge needs, and attitudes, we iteratively developed short learning units that ground the abstract AI topics in concrete case scenarios taken from the public sector. First results of an expert evaluation (expertise in adult education, public sector, and AI) look promising and further evaluations with the target group are planned. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: adult education;  artificial intelligence;  civil servants;  E-government;  moocs;  public sectorDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKristofik, S., Malik, P., Kasas, M.55817599100;15923234100;57219847156;StarCraft strategy classification of a large human versus human game replay dataset(2021) Proceedings of the 16th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems, FedCSIS 2021, pp. 137-140.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117815735&doi=10.15439%2f2021F48&partnerID=40&md5=f8916bfef6c4aa0fcbd31f5dfd5e2d24DOI: 10.15439/2021F48ABSTRACT: Real-time strategy games are popular in AI research and education.

The study aimed to assess radiographer willingness to accept AI in radiology work practice and the impact of AI in work performance. An exploratory cross-sectional online survey conducted for radiographers working within the Middle East and India was conducted from May–August 2020. A previously validated survey used to obtain radiographer's demographics, knowledge, perceptions, organization readiness, and challenges of integrating AI into radiology. The survey was accessible for radiographers and distributed through the societies page. The survey was completed by 549 radiographers distributed as (77.6%, n = 426) from the Middle East while (22.4%, n = 123) from India. A majority (86%, n = 773) agreed that AI currently plays an important role in radiology and (88.0%, n = 483) expected that AI would play a role in radiology practice and image production. The challenges for AI implementation in practice were developing AI skills (42.8%, n = 235) and AI knowledge development (37.0%, n = 203). Participants showed high interest to integrate AI in under and postgraduate curriculum. There is excitement about what AI could offer, but education input is a requirement. Fears are expressed about job security and how radiology may work across all ages and educational backgrounds. Radiographers become aware of AI role and challenges, which can be improved by education and training. © 2021, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Knowledge;  Practice;  Radiography;  RadiologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusChiu, T.K.F.56435413000;A Holistic Approach to the Design of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education for K-12 Schools(2021) TechTrends, 65 (5), pp. 796-807.

Few studies have been conducted that can inform practitioners about how to design and implement AI-related curricula, and thus sustainable approaches that can inform the planning of quality curricula are required. Teachers’ perspectives are essential in this, to make sense of emerging AI technology. Thus, this study develops a model of curriculum design that includes the four aspects of content, produce, process, and praxis. It conducts a thematic analysis of data collected from 12 K-12 schools, which includes individual interviews, teaching documents, and meeting minutes from 24 teachers. The findings thus reveal six key components: AI knowledge, AI processes, the impact of AI (content and product), student relevance, teacher-student communication, and flexibility (process and praxis). Thus, this study proposes a holistic approach to design AI K-12 curriculum. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence (AI) education;  Curriculum design;  Holistic approach;  K-12 schoolsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusShin, S.57226643751;A study on the framework design of artificial intelligence thinking for artificial intelligence education(2021) International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 11 (9), pp. 392-397.

The text mining method was conducted using text crawling and co-word analysis to design and define AI thinking using the Python programming language. The cosine similarity and word2vec techniques were used to perform co-word analysis. Cosine similarity extracts paired words by assigning a weight according to the frequency of appearance. The skip-gram of word2Vec examines the surrounding words and predicts the paired words. According to the co-word analysis results, AI thinking is using an integrated thinking process to solve decision problems by discussing, providing, demonstrating, and proving processes. Moreover, AI thinking must be considered in future research on AI education. This study aims to serve as the foundational research to move forward in AI education. © 2021, International Journal of Information and Education Technology.

In 2012, Kaggle hosted an Automated Student Assessment Prize contest to find effective solutions to automated testing and grading. This article: a) analyzes the datasets from the contest – which contained hand-graded essays – to measure their suitability for developing competent automated grading tools; b) evaluates the potential for deep learning in automated essay scoring (AES) to produce sophisticated testing and grading algorithms; c) advocates for thorough and transparent performance reports on AES research, which will facilitate fairer comparisons among various AES systems and permit study replication; d) uses both deep neural networks and state-of-the-art NLP tools to predict finer-grained rubric scores, to illustrate how rubric scores are determined from a linguistic perspective, and to uncover important features of an effective rubric scoring model. This study’s findings first highlight the level of agreement that exists between two human raters for each rubric as captured in the investigated essay dataset, that is, 0.60 on average as measured by the quadratic weighted kappa (QWK). Only one related study has been found in the literature which also performed rubric score predictions through models trained on the same dataset. At best, the predictive models had an average agreement level (QWK) of 0.53 with the human raters, below the level of agreement among human raters. In contrast, this research’s findings report an average agreement level per rubric with the two human raters’ resolved scores of 0.72 (QWK), well beyond the agreement level between the two human raters. Further, the AES system proposed in this article predicts holistic essay scores through its predicted rubric scores and produces a QWK of 0.78, a competitive performance according to recent literature where cutting-edge AES tools generate agreement levels between 0.77 and 0.81, results computed as per the same procedure as in this article. This study’s AES system goes one step further toward interpretability and the provision of high-level explanations to justify the predicted holistic and rubric scores. It contends that predicting rubric scores is essential to automated essay scoring, because it reveals the reasoning behind AIED-based AES systems. Will building AIED accountability improve the trustworthiness of the formative feedback generated by AES? Will AIED-empowered AES systems thoroughly mimic, or even outperform, a competent human rater? Will such machine-grading systems be subjected to verification by human raters, thus paving the way for a human-in-the-loop assessment mechanism? Will trust in new generations of AES systems be improved with the addition of models that explain the inner workings of a deep learning black box? This study seeks to expand these horizons of AES to make the technique practical, explainable, and trustable. © 2020, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Automated essay scoring;  Deep learning;  Feature importance;  Natural language processing;  Neural network;  RubricsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusPark, C.J., Yi, P.H., Siegel, E.L.57212347998;55365209900;56691859000;Medical Student Perspectives on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Practice of Medicine(2021) Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology, 50 (5), pp. 614-619.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate United States of America medical students’ perceptions about radiology and other medical specialties in relation to AI. Methods: An anonymous, web-based survey was sent to 32 radiology interest groups at United States medical schools. The survey was comprised of 6 questions assessing medical student perceptions of AI and its potential impact on radiology and other medical specialties. Responses were voluntary and collected over a 6-month period from November 2017 to April 2018. Results: A total of 156 students responded with representation from each year of medical school. Over 75% agreed that AI would have a significant role in the future of medicine. Most (66%) agreed that diagnostic radiology would be the specialty most greatly affected. Nearly half (44%) reported that AI made them less enthusiastic about radiology. The majority of students (57%) obtained their information about AI from online articles. Thematic analysis of free answer comments revealed mostly neutral comments towards AI, however, the negative responses were the strongest and most detailed. Conclusions: US medical students believe that AI will play a significant role in medicine, particularly in radiology. However, nearly half are less enthusiastic about the field of radiology due to AI. As the majority receive information about AI from online articles, which may have negative sentiments towards AI's impact on radiology, formal AI education and medical student outreach may help combat misinformation and help prevent the dissuading of medical students who might otherwise consider the specialty. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusZhao, W., Wang, Z., Zhu, L.57245290300;57245011100;57245011200;Research on the Application of AI in the Field of Education Big Data Mining(2021) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1992 (3), art. no. 032091, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114211710&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1992%2f3%2f032091&partnerID=40&md5=c4237492932ea3833df1599c8f10bc6fDOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1992/3/032091ABSTRACT: With the global summit on AI and education Big data (hereinafter referred to as BD), the deep integration of AI and education will bring more opportunities.

AI will transform higher education (HE) institutions through improved adaptation and competitiveness. The application of AI in HE is an emerging research area with limited review. Our paper seeks to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and visualisation of research on AI application in HE in the past two decades. We evaluated 283 articles published by researchers from 59 countries in the Scopus database over the past two decades based on explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study applied various bibliometric indicators and word analysis to examine emergent trends. VOSviewer was used for visualisations to map a knowledge base by uncovering keywords used within AI in HE. The results show the number of AI articles published per year, their geographic distribution, analysis by subject area and keywords, and research trends. Research in AI is interdisciplinary, dominated by computer science and engineering fields. AI research in HE is growing, the first 15 years contributed 22%, and the last five years yielded 78%. Countries with a high investment in research dominated AI research, with China and the United States leading. There is very little research from developing countries. Our paper highlights current and future research directions in AI in education, and its limitations. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  bibliometrics;  emerging technologies;  higher education;  visualisationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSun, Z., Anbarasan, M., Praveen Kumar, D.57219187924;56925264400;57211860773;Design of online intelligent English teaching platform based on artificial intelligence techniques(2021) Computational Intelligence, 37 (3), pp. 1166-1180.

There are currently many AIEd-driven applications in schools and universities. This paper applies an artificial intelligence module combined with the knowledge recommendation to the system and develops an online English teaching system in comparison with the common teaching auxiliary system. The method of English teaching is useful in investigating the potential internal connections between evaluation outcomes and various factors. This article develops deep learning-assisted online intelligent English teaching system that utilizes to create a modern tool platform to help students improve their English language teaching efficiency in line with their mastery of knowledge and personality. The decision tree algorithm and neural networks have been used and to generate an English teaching assessment implementation model based on decision tree technologies. It provides valuable data from extensive information, summarizes rules and data, and helps teachers to improve their education and the English scores of students. This system reflects the thinking of the artificial intelligence expert system. Test application demonstrates that the system can help students improve their learning efficiency and will make learning content more relevant. Besides, the system provides an example model with similar methods and has a referential definition. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence education;  deep learning;  online English teaching platformDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusQiu, X.57232716900;Study on Korean Language Teaching Evaluation Scheme Using Artificial Intelligence Technology(2021) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems, ICCES 2021, art. no. 9489261, pp. 1573-1576.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113771147&doi=10.1109%2fICCES51350.2021.9489261&partnerID=40&md5=d059f885339080eba9712e40e836c0a1DOI: 10.1109/ICCES51350.2021.9489261ABSTRACT: At present, Korean teaching in domestic colleges and universities can be said to be limited to the traditional teaching model of face-to-face teaching by teachers and students. This teaching mode is not only boring, it is difficult to improve students' interest in learning. Students are in a passive position of receiving knowledge, which is not conducive to the development of students' language application ability, and at the same time, it is difficult to realize information exchange and emotional exchange between teachers and students. If you want to master a language, you must first master certain vocabulary, so vocabulary teaching is the most basic content of language teaching in Korean. The advent of artificial intelligence technology has lowered the barriers for children to access quality education, and education has been democratized and liberalized, so everyone has an equal right to receive quality education. Using the AI-based education model, teachers can better grasp students' learning and correct them. Students can also communicate and evaluate each other's homework, so as to achieve the purpose of mutual learning and common progress. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Autoencoder;  Clustering Algorithm;  Gaussian ModelDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusPaek, S., Kim, N.57225095405;33767745300;Analysis of worldwide research trends on the impact of artificial intelligence in education(2021) Sustainability (Switzerland), 13 (14), art. no. 7941, .

At present, education cannot be discussed without mentioning AI, which has an omnidirectional impact on all its areas, including the purpose, content, method, and evaluation system. This study aimed to explore the future direction of education by examining the current impact and predicting future impacts of AI. It also examined research trends and collaboration status by country through network analysis, topic modeling and global research trends in AI in education (AIED), by applying the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. Over the past 20 years, the number of papers on AIED has steadily increased, with a dramatic rise since 2015. The research can be broadly classified into eight topics, including “changes in the content of teaching and learning.” Using a linear regression model, three hot topics, two cold topics and trend changes for each research topic were identified. The study found that AIED research should be more thematically diversified and in-depth; this directly applies AI algorithms and technologies to education, which should be further promoted. This study provides a reference for exploring the direction of future AIED research. © 2021 by the authors.

One such advancement relates to the use of educational data to track students' knowledge state [1]. In the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education knowledge tracing is a well-established area where a machine models the students' knowledge as they interact with coursework. Effective modeling of student knowledge can have a high impact on the provision of adaptive learning. In fact, lately, research on knowledge tracing is intensifying with a particular focus on the utilisation of new machine learning algorithms for modelling the students' knowledge levels and for the prediction of performance on future tasks and assessment questions [2]. In the case of question-level assessment, knowledge tracing provides an interpretation of the learner's current knowledge level and models their mastery of the skill or knowledge component to which future questions are related [3]. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive Learning;  Artificial Intelligence;  Intelligent Education;  Knowledge tracing;  Question level predictionDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusAfzaal, M., Nouri, J., Zia, A., Papapetrou, P., Fors, U., Wu, Y., Li, X., Weegar, R.57222307128;36608737900;57257853100;21734741500;6603396865;57257970000;57258078100;56462951100;Automatic and intelligent recommendations to support students' self-regulation(2021) Proceedings - IEEE 21st International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2021, pp. 336-338.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114874000&doi=10.1109%2fICALT52272.2021.00107&partnerID=40&md5=d12995cc0c3b86a0a8d8ecdd830d5009DOI: 10.1109/ICALT52272.2021.00107ABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose a counterfactual explanations-based approach to provide an automatic and intelligent recommendation that supports student's self-regulation of learning in a data-driven manner, aiming to improve their performance in courses.

We use AI to accurately assist people in performing daily tasks through a machine learning process. In education, we can use AI in many situations, such as predicting student's learning outcome and discovering student's learning strategies. However, most solutions have not yet utilized modern AI capabilities, such as natural language processing. This research aims to help teachers use machines to automatically generate short answer questions to reduce the time for teachers to write exam questions. In addition, the main reason we focus on short answers is that many studies prove that short answer exercises can enhance student's long-term memory, thereby improving their learning performance. We propose an automatic question generation (AQG) system that combines syntax-base and semantics-base, in order to prove that the system is highly available and improve student's learning performance, we conducted experiments with 41 students. The experimental results show that student's learning performance has been significantly improved, which means that by repeatedly testing the machine question generation system, students can deepen their long-term memory of course knowledge. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Automatic question generation;  Learning outcome;  Repeated testingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHuang-Fu, C.-Y., Liao, C.-H., Wu, J.-Y.57258297300;57222481261;36174675900;Comparing the performance of machine learning and deep learning algorithms classifying messages in Facebook learning group(2021) Proceedings - IEEE 21st International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2021, pp. 347-349.

Education in this regard should become the starting point or the basis for the competent and conscious application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, neural networks, and other cyber-physical systems based on AI, as well as robots and robotics objects. Digitalization in education is promoted by economic, social and structural prerequisites. The introduction of these technologies provides new opportunities to improve the educational process, but at the same time the application of these technologies faces some risks, the identification of negative consequences of which is delayed. The aim of the article is to provide the ways for the development of legal regulation of AI, robots and robotics objects in education. The study considers the experience of different countries in the implementation of AI technologies in the educational process, provides the opinions of international UNESCO experts, Russian and foreign researchers. According to the results of the research, three main directions of the relationship between the development of AI technologies and education are identified: 1) training with the help of AI technologies; 2) scientific and practical research of AI and its technologies; 3) training qualified specialists to work with AI in the process of obtaining secondary and higher education. The factors that hinder the implementation of these technologies, as well as the risks of negative consequences of their use in the form of violations of the students’ rights are revealed.

A variety of artificial intelligence application products continue to appear, playing various important roles in many fields, such as AI + agriculture, AI + medical, AI + autonomous driving, AI + education, etc. The combination of artificial intelligence and traditional industries The emergence of artificial intelligence has made these traditional industries shine. In the field of artificial intelligence, there is a very important sub field - Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the development of various industries, the scale of data generated by various industries is increasing, and the problem of information overload is becoming more and more serious, so how to quickly and accurately Obtaining key information in the data is of great significance. However, the text data generated by all walks of life is often unstructured and diverse in types. Therefore, in recent years, information extraction in the field of natural language has become a research hotspot, and person relationship extraction is an important branch of information extraction. Person relationship extraction is the core task of text mining and information extraction, and its task is to identify sentences. The semantic relationship between two person name entities, in recent years, person relationship extraction has been widely promoted and applied in various aspects, such as intelligent semantic search, character knowledge graph construction, question and answer systems, etc. It performs well. Therefore, it is of great significance to design and develop a set of Chinese character relationship extraction system. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a BERT-based Chinese character relationship extraction architecture. Its fusion model architecture is BERT+BI-LSTM+Multi-head-Self-Attention+FC. The current popular deep learning for Chinese character relationship extraction the model of has a better effect on the relationship extraction of a single character relationship pair. However, when it is extended to single-sentence multi-person relationship pairs and document-level semantic complexity, the evaluation index data of this model is not high. Through comparison, it is found that BERT has a significant improvement in the pre-training effect of the word2vec model, and the BI-LSTM+Multi-head-Self-Attention model has a significant improvement in the effect of a single LSTM model. Therefore, the proposed BERT+BI-LSTM +Multi-head-Self-Attention+ FC fusion model has certain practical value in Chinese character relationship extraction. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Attention;  BERT;  NLP;  Relationship;  TriplesDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusVoulgari, I., Zammit, M., Stouraitis, E., Liapis, A., Yannakakis, G.24825483100;57226000737;57195428369;53264261900;14036725000;Learn to Machine Learn: Designing a Game Based Approach for Teaching Machine Learning to Primary and Secondary Education Students(2021) Proceedings of Interaction Design and Children, IDC 2021, pp. 593-598.

To address this increasing need for AI literacy skills, particularly for younger students, this paper presents the rationale of the LearnML project which aims to develop a framework and game-based educational material for promoting AI literacy among primary and secondary education students. We also describe the design and initial assessment of the game "ArtBot", developed as part of the LearnML project. We review existing literature, discuss the educational game design and development of "ArtBot"and describe the initial feedback of students and teachers. Our goal is to provide insights and suggest guidelines for the implementation of game-based learning environments for supporting AI literacy skills of students. © 2021 Owner/Author.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  AI literacy;  digital literacy skills;  educational game design;  Game-based learning;  machine learning;  primary education;  secondary educationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusVan Brummelen, J., Tabunshchyk, V., Heng, T.57192586710;57221148793;57221140972;Alexa, Can i Program You?": Student Perceptions of Conversational Artificial Intelligence before and after Programming Alexa(2021) Proceedings of Interaction Design and Children, IDC 2021, pp. 305-313.

Conversational agents could influence how students anthropomorphize computer systems or develop a theory of mind. Previous research has explored how conversational agents are used and perceived by children within and outside of learning contexts. This study investigates how middle and high school students' perceptions of Alexa change through programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops' influence on student perceptions of Alexa's intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness, trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the workshops. We also found strong correlations between students' perceptions of Alexa's friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness. We recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency, playfulness and utility when designing conversational agents for learning contexts. © 2021 Owner/Author.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  child-agent interaction;  conversational agents;  pedagogical agent design;  personaDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusLong, D., Padiyath, A., Teachey, A., Magerko, B.57195131855;57219715581;57225074752;6506227997;The Role of Collaboration, Creativity, and Embodiment in AI Learning Experiences(2021) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, art. no. 3465264, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109079789&doi=10.1145%2f3450741.3465264&partnerID=40&md5=5470577ac721801a63af48a24b027eb2DOI: 10.1145/3450741.3465264ABSTRACT: Fostering public AI literacy (i.e. a high-level understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows individuals to critically and effectively use AI technologies) is increasingly important as AI is integrated into individuals' everyday lives and as concerns about AI grow.

Elaborated feedback is thus a challenge for AI in education systems because it requires dynamic explanations, which traditionally require logical reasoning and knowledge engineering to generate. This study presents an alternative approach that formulates elaborated feedback in terms of long-form question answering (LFQA). An off-the-shelf LFQA system was evaluated by human raters in a 2x2x2x2 ablation design that manipulated the context documents given to the LFQA model and the post-processing of model output. Results indicate that context manipulations improve performance but that post-processing can have detrimental results. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: deep learning;  elaborated feedback;  human evaluation;  information retrieval;  natural language generation;  question answeringDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusQian, Z.57280885400;Applications, Risks and Countermeasures of Artificial Intelligence in Education(2021) Proceedings - 2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education, ICAIE 2021, pp. 89-92.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116170983&doi=10.1109%2fICAIE53562.2021.00026&partnerID=40&md5=676fa445c28d90ff0c307e91880c3ebbDOI: 10.1109/ICAIE53562.2021.00026ABSTRACT: The application of artificial intelligence in education has greatly affected school management, teachers' teaching and students' learning, and has an important influence on the mechanism and mechanism of learning process. The concept of artificial intelligence is to simulate human intelligence by machine, thus completing specific roles and tasks, and has the characteristics of convenience, intelligence and interaction. It is mainly applied to computer vision, natural language processing, biometric recognition, speech recognition, human-computer interaction and other technologies in the field of education, which brings space for the development of architecture, medicine and chemistry. However, AI also brings about the risk of decisionmaking mistakes, career substitution, privacy leakage, information cocoon house and data bias. In order to avoid these risks effectively, this paper puts forward solutions from five perspectives: the state, product developers, educational managers, teachers and students, so as to correctly understand the relationship between artificial intelligence and education, explore the application mode of artificial intelligence in the field of education, and ensure the deep integration of artificial intelligence and education. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Educational application;  Educational riskDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusChen, J., Zhan, X., Wang, Y., Huang, X.57280945600;57280189600;57280820200;57281069500;Medical Robots based on Artificial Intelligence in the Medical Education(2021) Proceedings - 2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education, ICAIE 2021, pp. 481-485.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116145143&doi=10.1109%2fICAIE53562.2021.00008&partnerID=40&md5=d102c155be165029daa1673f87df5edaDOI: 10.1109/ICAIE53562.2021.00008ABSTRACT: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, more and more scientific and technological achievements in the information age have been widely used in various fields of society. At the same time, the rapid development of intelligence has also continuously promoted the progress of medical education, and more and more robots have been applied to the field of medical education. The main purpose of this research is to analyze the current situation of using artificial intelligence-based medical robots in medical education to determine its effect on improving medical education. We have proposed a method for using medical robots based on artificial intelligence technology to help medical students conduct more efficient skills training and professional knowledge acquisition. Medical education based on AI use the robots to act as a human body model, perform scene simulation, act as a "medical encyclopedia", perform pharmacological simulation reactions, and finally automatically evaluate students' medical knowledge mastery level. All in all, integrating various artificial intelligence technologies into medical education, aroused the interest of medical students in learning, and greatly improved the results of teaching. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Medical education;  Medical robotsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusZhang, Y., Ning, Y., Li, B., Jun, Y.57221362256;8706591700;57222117200;57281021500;The research on talent education for AI-based IoT system development and implementation by the CDIO concept(2021) Proceedings - 2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education, ICAIE 2021, pp. 110-114.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116143477&doi=10.1109%2fICAIE53562.2021.00031&partnerID=40&md5=b469ecad398550d4c8e298fb1c7a0bd2DOI: 10.1109/ICAIE53562.2021.00031ABSTRACT: This paper puts forward the talent training mode for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) system development and implementation based on the CDIO concept to meet the goal of information technology education.

In the past, teachers mainly relied on relevant teaching materials to prepare lessons, but now teachers can use artificial intelligence technology to prepare lessons, which reduces the burden of preparing lessons for teachers. Artificial intelligence, referred to as AI for short, is a branch of computer science, and it is a discipline that studies how to make computers simulate people's thinking and intelligent behavior. The application of artificial intelligence in education can promote education equality and improve teaching efficiency. For example, in some remote mountain schools, educational resources are scarce. The application of artificial intelligence can integrate and share educational resources to the network platform to achieve education equality. Then, this paper analyzes and explores how to change the teaching methods in the future. Starting from the current situation of the development of artificial intelligence in China and combining with the current teaching, it continuously analyzes and studies the teaching methods incorporating artificial intelligence to promote the systematic reform and development of future teaching. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  future teaching;  reform;  systematicDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusEguchi, A., Okada, H., Muto, Y.8905708600;36096878400;34870247700;Contextualizing AI Education for K-12 Students to Enhance Their Learning of AI Literacy Through Culturally Responsive Approaches(2021) KI - Kunstliche Intelligenz, 35 (2), pp. 153-161.

Furthermore, AI-enhanced technologies and tools are no strangers in the field of education. It is more evident that it is important to prepare K-12 population of students for their future professions as well as citizens capable of understanding and utilizing AI-enhanced technologies in the future. In response to such needs, the authors started a collaborative project aiming to provide a K-12 AI curriculum for Japanese students. However, the authors soon realized that it is important to contextualize the learning experience for the targeted K-12 students. The paper aims at introducing the idea of contextualizing AI education and learning experience of K-12 students with examples and tips using the work-in-progress version of the contextualized curriculum using culturally responsive approaches to promote the awareness and understanding of AI ethics among middle school students. © 2021, Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI literacy;  Contextualization;  Cultural context;  Culturally responsive pedagogy;  K-12 AI educationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusLee, Y., Cho, J.36602873100;7403536103;Development of an artificial intelligence education model of classification techniques for non-computer majors(2021) International Journal on Informatics Visualization, 5 (2), pp. 113-119.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111075096&doi=10.30630%2fjoiv.5.2.552&partnerID=40&md5=d2e187c55f2ddfd4b5f025b86c08d618DOI: 10.30630/joiv.5.2.552ABSTRACT: In the near future, as artificial intelligence and computing network technology develop, collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) will become important. In an AI society, the ability to communicate and collaborate among people is an important element of talent. To do this, it is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence based on computer science works. AI is being rapidly applied across industries and is developing as a core technology to enable a society led by knowledge and information. An AI education focused on problem solving and learning is efficient for computer science education. Thus, the time has come to prepare for AI education along with existing software education so that they can adapt to the social and job changes enabled by AI. In this paper, we explain a classification method for AI machine learning models and propose an AI education model using teachable machines. Non-computer majors can understand the importance of data and the AI model concept based on specific cases using AI education tools to understand and experiment with AI even without the knowledge of mathematics, and use languages such as Python, if necessary. Through the application of the machine learning model, AI can be smoothly utilized in their field of interest. If such an AI education model is activated, it will be possible to suggest the direction of AI education for collaboration with AI experts through the application of AI technology. © 2021, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

As healthy eating is a cornerstone of diabetes self-management, nutrition education plays an important role in diabetes self-management education. Objective: To understand stakeholder perspectives on facilitators and barriers to healthy eating for AI/AN adults with T2D in order to inform the cultural adaptation of an existing diabetes nutrition education curriculum. Methods: Individual interviews were conducted with 9 national content experts in diabetes nutrition education (e.g. registered dietitians, diabetes educators, experts on AI/AN food insecurity) and 10 community-based key informants, including tribal health administrators, nutrition/diabetes educators, Native elders, and tribal leaders. Four focus groups were conducted with AI/AN adults with T2D (n = 29) and 4 focus groups were conducted with their family members (n = 22). Focus groups and community-based key informant interviews were conducted at 4 urban and reservation sites in the USA. Focus groups and interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. We employed the constant comparison method for data analysis and used Atlas.ti (Mac version 8.0) to digitalize the analytic process. Results: Three key themes emerged. First, a diabetes nutrition education program for AI/ANs should accommodate diversity across AI/AN communities. Second, it is important to build on AI/AN strengths and facilitators to healthy eating (e.g. strong community and family support systems, traditional foods, and food acquisition and preparation practices). Third, it is important to address barriers to healthy eating (e.g. food insecurity, challenges to preparation of home-cooked meals, excessive access to processed and fast food, competing priorities and stressors, loss of access to traditional foods, and traditional food-acquisition practices and preparation) and provide resources and strategies for mitigating these barriers. Conclusions: Findings were used to inform the cultural adaptation of a nutrition education program for AI/AN adults with T2D.

The concept was developed in reaction to the recent AI surge and corresponding demand for foundational teaching on the subject to a broad and diverse audience, with on-site teaching of small classes in mind and designed to build on the specific strengths in motivational public speaking of the lecturers. The research question and focus of our evaluation is to what extent the concept serves this purpose, specifically taking into account the necessary but unforeseen transfer to ongoing hybrid and fully online teaching since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution is two-fold: besides (i) presenting a general didactic concept for tertiary engineering education in AI and ML, ready for adoption, we (ii) draw conclusions from the comparison of qualitative student evaluations (n = 24–30) and quantitative exam results (n = 62–113) of two full semesters under pandemic conditions with the result of previous years (participants from Zurich, Switzerland). This yields specific recommendations for the adoption of any technical curriculum under flexible teaching conditions—be it on-site, hybrid, or online. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

Flipped teaching is a teaching strategy frequently used in colleges and universities. The focus of this research was conducted by a comparative analysis of the cognitive load between the experimental group and the control group through a quasi-experimental design for research with different learning methods and different classes. More specifically, flipped teaching was carried out with an experimental group, and traditional teaching a control group; they were observed at the same time, and 213 private university students participated in the experiment. The research proposes a practice of mixed teaching, carried out in a group communication behavior system, and enhancing the spirit of group interaction and learning through mobile devices. The core value of the research lies in (1) online learning, (2) group interaction, and (3) the learning load of the conceptual model. In addition, focus group interviews were used to provide feedback on participants’ cognition and emotions. The results indicate that there were differences in cognitive load between the two classes. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we determine what teacher competencies are necessary for improving the teaching and learning of AI for K-12 with Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. First, we identify current AI education resources and investigate the core foundations of AI taught to K-12. Based on the findings, we propose teacher competency for K-12 AI education by analyzing AI curricula and resources using the TPACK framework.

Understanding what AI is good for, how to evaluate it, what are its limitations, and how it can be implemented are not well understood. With a survey, we aimed to evaluate the thoughts of stakeholders in laboratory medicine on the value of AI in the diagnostics space and identify anticipated challenges and solutions to introducing AI. Methods: We conducted a web-based survey on the use of AI with participants from Roche's Strategic Advisory Network that included key stakeholders in laboratory medicine. Results: In total, 128 of 302 stakeholders responded to the survey. Most of the participants were medical practitioners (26%) or laboratory managers (22%). AI is currently used in the organizations of 15.6%, while 66.4% felt they might use it in the future. Most had an unsure attitude on what they would need to adopt AI in the diagnostics space. High investment costs, lack of proven clinical benefits, number of decision makers, and privacy concerns were identified as barriers to adoption. Education in the value of AI, streamlined implementation and integration into existing workflows, and research to prove clinical utility were identified as solutions needed to mainstream AI in laboratory medicine. Conclusions: This survey demonstrates that specific knowledge of AI in the medical community is poor and that AI education is much needed.

In this paper we introduce an open educational approach of artificial intelligence (AI) for everyone. Through a hybrid and participative MOOC we aim to develop a critical and creative perspective about the way AI is integrated in the different domains of our lives. We have built and now operate a MOOC in AI for all the citizens from 15 years old. The MOOC aims to help understanding AI foundations and applications, intended for a large public beyond the school domain, with more than 20,000 participants engaged in the MOOC after nine months. This study addresses the pedagogical methods for designing and evaluating the MOOC in AI. Through this study we raise four questions regarding citizen education in AI: Why (i.e., to which aim) sharing such citizen formation? What is the disciplinary knowledge to be shared? What are the competencies to develop? How can it be shared and evaluated? We finally share learning analytics, quantitative and qualitative evaluations and explain to which extent educational science research helps enlighten such large scale initiatives. The analysis of the MOOC in AI helps to identify that the main feedback related to AI is “fear”, because AI is unknown and mysterious to the participants. After developing playful AI simulations, the AI mechanisms become familiar for the MOOC participants and they can overcome their misconception on AI to develop a more critical point of view.

In recent years, AI and Robotics have become major topics with a huge impact not only on our everyday life but also on the working environment. Hence, sound knowledge about principles and concepts of AI and Robotics are key skills for this century. Nonetheless, hardly any systematic approaches exist that focus on teaching principles of intelligent systems at K-12 level, addressing students as well as teachers who act as multipliers. In order to meet this challenge, the European Driving License for Robots and Intelligent Systems—EDLRIS was developed. It is based on a number of previously implemented and evaluated projects and comprises teaching curricula and training modules for AI and Robotics, following a competency-based, blended learning approach. Additionally, a certification system proves peoples’ acquired competencies. After developing the training and certification system, the first 32 trainer and trainee courses with a total of 445 participants have been implemented and evaluated. By applying this innovative approach—a standardized and widely recognized training and certification system for AI and Robotics at K-12 level for both high school teachers and students—we envision to foster AI/Robotics literacy on a broad basis. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Curriculum development;  Digitalization;  Education in AI;  Educational robotics;  Intelligent systems;  K-12;  RoboticsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusMatayoshi, J., Cosyn, E., Uzun, H.53877899300;6506356308;7004285756;Are We There Yet?

In most cases, this is done by comparing their performance to existing models in the artificial intelligence in education (AIED) and educational data mining (EDM) fields. While there is increasing evidence that, in many situations, RNN models can improve on the performance of these existing methods, in this work we take a different approach. Rather than directly comparing RNNs with other models, we are instead interested in the results when RNNs are combined with one of these existing models. In particular, we attempt to improve the performance of ALEKS (“A ssessment and LE arning in K nowledge S paces”), an adaptive learning and assessment system based on Knowledge Space Theory, through the use of RNN models. Using data from more than 1.4 million ALEKS assessments, we first build an RNN classifier that attempts to predict the final result of each assessment. After verifying the accuracy of these predictions, we develop our stopping algorithm, with the goal of improving the efficiency of the ALEKS assessment by reducing the total number of questions that are asked. Based on this stopping algorithm, we give a comprehensive analysis of the possible effects it would have on students. We show that the combination of an RNN with the ALEKS assessment can reduce the average assessment length by over 26%, while a high degree of accuracy is maintained. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive assessment;  Deep learning;  Knowledge Space Theory;  Recurrent neural networksDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusFeng, S., Law, N.57190013027;7005934146;Mapping Artificial Intelligence in Education Research: a Network‐based Keyword Analysis(2021) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 31 (2), pp. 277-303.

A novel three-step approach in the analysis of the keyword co-occurrence networks (KCN) is proposed to identify the knowledge structure, knowledge clusters and trending keywords within AIED over time. The results reveal considerable research diversity in the AIED field, centering around two sustained themes: intelligent tutoring systems (2010-19) and massive open online courses (since 2014). The focal educational concerns reflected in AIED research are: (1) online learning; (2) game-based learning; (3) collaborative learning; (4) assessment; (5) affect; (6) engagement; and (7) learning design. The highly connected keywords relevant to analytic techniques within this field include natural language processing, educational data mining, learning analytics and machine learning. Neural network, deep learning, eye tracking, and personalized learning are trending keywords in this field as they have emerged with key structural roles in the latest two-year period analyzed. This is the first article providing a systematic review of a large body of literature on artificial intelligence in education, and in it we uncover the underlying patterns of knowledge connectivity within the field, as well as provide insight into its future development. The three-step multi-scale (macro, meso, micro) framework proposed in this study can also be applied to map the knowledge development in other scientific research areas. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence in education;  Keyword co‐occurrence network;  Knowledge mapping;  Network analysis;  Systematic reviewDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusDavies, H.C., Eynon, R., Salveson, C.55479617400;23469134400;57220187089;The Mobilisation of AI in Education: A Bourdieusean Field Analysis(2021) Sociology, 55 (3), pp. 539-560.

Though few sociologists of education would agree with its deterministic claims, this AI solutionist thinking is gaining significant currency. In this article, using a relatively novel method for sociology – a knowledge graph – together with Bourdieusean theory, we critically examine how and why different stakeholders in education, educational technology and policy are valorising AI, the main concepts, such as personalisation, they collectively endorse and their incentives for doing so. Drawing on this analysis, we argue that AI is currently being mobilised in education in problematic ways and advocate for more systematic sociological thinking and research to re-orientate the field to account for society’s structural conditions. © The Author(s) 2020.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Bourdieu;  edtech;  education;  inequality;  knowledge graphsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusWang, L.57224514610;Research on the construction of artificial intelligence aesthetic education platform based on moodle(2021) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1915 (4), art. no. 042032, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107720080&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1915%2f4%2f042032&partnerID=40&md5=1ecb37ef550f3e187d67f736d271efccDOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1915/4/042032ABSTRACT: At present, most schools are short of intelligent teaching platform resources for aesthetic education, which leads to the lack of personality education and emotional education, as well as the poor interaction and experience of emotional communication.

However, little research has investigated how AI curriculum and tools can be designed to be more accessible to all teachers and learners. In this study, we take a Value-Sensitive Design approach to understanding the role of teacher values in the design of AI curriculum and tools, and identifying opportunities to integrate AI into core curriculum to leverage learners' interests. We organized co-design workshops with 15 K-12 teachers, where teachers and researchers co-created lesson plans using AI tools and embedding AI concepts into various core subjects.We found that K12 teachers need additional scafolding in AI tools and curriculum to facilitate ethics and data discussions, and value supports for learner evaluation and engagement, peer-to-peer collaboration, and critical refection. We present an exemplar lesson plan that shows entry points for teaching AI in non-computing subjects and refect on co-designing with K-12 teachers in a remote setting. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artifcial intelligence;  Co-design;  K-12 educationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusHsu, S., Wentin, T., Zhang, Z., Fowler, M.57219114442;57220635279;57215652265;57190129692;Atitudes surrounding an imperfect ai autograder(2021) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, .

This paper presents students' perceptions surrounding a ~90% accurate automated short-answer grader that determined homework and exam credit in a college-level computer science course. Using surveys and interviews, we investigated students' knowledge about the autograder and their attitudes. We observed that misalignment between folk theories about how the autograder worked and how it actually worked could lead to suboptimal answer construction strategies. Students overestimated the autograder's probability of marking correct answers as wrong, and estimates of this probability were associated with dissatisfaction and perceptions of unfairness. Many participants expressed a need for additional instruction on how to cater to the autograder. From these fndings, we propose guidelines for incorporating imperfect short answer autograders into classroom in a manner that is considerate of students' needs. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Asag;  Autograder;  Code reading;  Computer science education;  Eipe;  Folk theories;  Human-ai interaction;  Imperfect ai;  Perception and acceptance of aiDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusAli, S., DiPaola, D., Lee, I., Hong, J., Breazeal, C.57207448534;57208863454;37049104500;57224002868;7003691791;Exploring generative models with middle school students(2021) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, .

While GANs are associated with ethical implications pertaining to children, such as the generation of Deepfakes, there are negligible eforts to educate middle school children about generative AI. In this work, we present a generative models learning trajectory (LT), educational materials, and interactive activities for young learners with a focus on GANs, creation and application of machine-generated media, and its ethical implications. The activities were deployed in four online workshops with 72 students (grades 5-9).We found that these materials enabled children to gain an understanding of what generative models are, their technical components and potential applications, and benefts and harms, while refecting on their ethical implications. Learning from our fndings, we propose an improved learning trajectory for complex socio-technical systems. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Ai education;  Artifcial intelligence;  Generative adversarial networks;  Generative machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusZhou, X., Tong, Y., Lan, X., Zheng, K., Zhan, Z.57271516600;57271103800;57271647700;57271516700;36667808500;AI Education in Massive Open Online Courses: A Content Analysis(2021) Proceedings - 2021 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education, CSTE 2021, pp. 80-85.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115673592&doi=10.1109%2fCSTE53634.2021.00023&partnerID=40&md5=07be2fcd05266c83877df7a8014e3822DOI: 10.1109/CSTE53634.2021.00023ABSTRACT: This study aims to explore the current state of AI education in massive open online courses (MOOCs).

Guizhou province is an area inhabited by ethnic minorities, located in the heart of Southwest China. The development of its intelligent education has strong enlightenment for the whole country and the region. Therefore, this paper selects the Baidu Index of “artificial intelligence (AI) + education” in Guizhou province from 2013 to 2020, analyzes the spatial–temporal characteristics of its network attention by using the elastic coefficient method, and builds the ARIMA model on this basis to predict future development. The results show that the public’s attention to “AI + education” differs significantly in time and space. Then, according to the prediction results, this paper puts forward relevant suggestions for the country to promote the sustainable development of education in western ethnic areas. © 2021 by the author.

Soon after the birth of Logo at BBN, Seymour Papert set up the Logo Group as part of the MIT AI Lab. Logo was based upon Lisp, the first prominent AI programming language. Many early Logo activities involved natural language processing, robotics, artificial game players, and generating poetry, art, and music. In the 1970s researchers explored enhancements to Logo to support AI programming by children. In the 1980s the Prolog community, inspired by Logo's successes, began exploring how to adapt logic programming for use by school children. While there have been over 40 years of active AI research in creating intelligent tutoring systems, there was little AI-flavoured constructionism after the 1980s until about 2017 when suddenly a great deal of activity started. Amongst those activities were attempts to enhance Scratch, Snap!, and MIT App Inventor with new blocks for speech synthesis, speech recognition, image recognition, and the use of pre-trained deep learning models. The Snap! enhancements also include support for word embeddings, as well as blocks to enable learners to create, train, and use deep neural networks. Student and teacher project-oriented resources highlighting these new AI programming components appeared at the same time. In this paper, we review this history, providing a unique perspective on AI developments—both social and technical—from a constructionist perspective. Reflecting on these, we close with speculations about possible futures for AI and constructionism. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There exist excellent broad surveys of the current status of teaching machine learning in schools, for example Marques et al. (2020). There are historical collections of AI and education research papers that include descriptions of constructionist activities, for example Yazdani (1984). What this paper adds This paper adds an in-depth focus on historical and current efforts on AI and education that support constructionist teaching. This focus enables us to delve deeper than a broad survey. Uniquely, we provide a 50-year historical perspective on constructionist AI tools, trials, and research. Grounded in this history and our survey of current tools and projects, we provide speculations about future directions. Implications for practice and/or policy We hope our descriptions of current AI programming tools for non-experts placed in a broad historical context will be of use to teachers wishing to introduce AI to their students in a constructionist manner, as well as to developers and researchers aiming to support such teaching. © 2021 The Authors.

This concept emerged several years ago and is being adopted by a rapidly growing number of educational institutions around the globe. In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), together with advances in big data analysis, has introduced novel perspectives that enhance personalized education in numerous ways. By taking advantage of AI/ML methods, the educational platform precisely acquires the student?s characteristics. This is done, in part, by observing past experiences as well as analyzing the available big data through exploring the learners' features and similarities. It can, for example, recommend the most appropriate content among numerous accessible ones, advise a well-designed long-term curriculum, and connect appropriate learners by suggestion, accurate performance evaluation, and so forth. Still, several aspects of AI-based personalized education remain unexplored. These include, among others, compensating for the adverse effects of the absence of peers, creating and maintaining motivations for learning, increasing the diversity, removing the biases induced by data and algorithms, and so on. In this article, while providing a brief review of state-of-the-art research, we investigate the challenges of AI/ML-based personalized education and discuss potential solutions. © 1991-2012 IEEE.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusSousa, M.J., Mas, F.D., Pesqueira, A., Lemos, C., Verde, J.M., Cobianchi, L.55480939900;57216833852;57210162257;57210147225;57086663700;8985994900;The Potential of AI in Health Higher Education to Increase the Students’ Learning Outcomes(2021) TEM Journal, 10 (2), pp. 488-497.

These technologies are meant to develop the process of communication, digital commerce, content, and apps. AI is also meant to initiate novel business frameworks and formulate a completely novel business opportunity as efficiencies and interfaces facilitate the engagement, which has been heretofore unintelligible. A number of industry verticals will be changed through this form of evolution, as digital and ICT technologies are critical in supporting the various aspects of industrial operations, which include sales, marketing processes, supply chains, product and service delivery, and support frameworks. For instance, substantial implication of the frameworks can be witnessed in medical and bioinformatics, including the financial service segments. Workforce automation is a field that will influence various industrial verticals, as AI significantly develops the flow of work, accelerations, and processes of the return on investment for intelligent workplace application. This paper signifies the role of AI in ICT education, including the way intelligent ICT education has significantly developed its application and challenges. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence (AI);  deep learning (DL);  information and communication technology (ICT);  machine learning (ML)DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKöbis, L., Mehner, C.57217295595;57223614210;Ethical Questions Raised by AI-Supported Mentoring in Higher Education(2021) Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 4, art. no. 624050, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117882965&doi=10.3389%2ffrai.2021.624050&partnerID=40&md5=525695b52b5557373c53cfbb9403bb9eDOI: 10.3389/frai.2021.624050ABSTRACT: Mentoring is a highly personal and individual process, in which mentees take advantage of expertise and experience to expand their knowledge and to achieve individual goals. The emerging use of AI in mentoring processes in higher education not only necessitates the adherence to applicable laws and regulations (e.g., relating to data protection and non-discrimination) but further requires a thorough understanding of ethical norms, guidelines, and unresolved issues (e.g., integrity of data, safety, and security of systems, and confidentiality, avoiding bias, insuring trust in and transparency of algorithms). Mentoring in Higher Education requires one of the highest degrees of trust, openness, and social–emotional support, as much is at the stake for mentees, especially their academic attainment, career options, and future life choices. However, ethical compromises seem to be common when digital systems are introduced, and the underlying ethical questions in AI-supported mentoring are still insufficiently addressed in research, development, and application. One of the challenges is to strive for privacy and data economy on the one hand, while Big Data is the prerequisite of AI-supported environments on the other hand. How can ethical norms and general guidelines of AIED be respected in complex digital mentoring processes? This article strives to start a discourse on the relevant ethical questions and in this way raise awareness for the ethical development and use of future data-driven, AI-supported mentoring environments in higher education. © Copyright © 2021 Köbis and Mehner.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  AIED;  ethics;  higher education;  mentoringDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusSyzdykbayeva, A., Baikulova, A., Kerimbayeva, R.56610316700;57190168487;57190750663;Introduction of Artificial Intelligence as the Basis of Modern Online Education on the Example of Higher Education(2021) SIST 2021 - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Information Systems and Technologies, art. no. 9465974, .

In recent years, the extensive application of AI technology has also accelerated the ET Reform under the background of AI. However, due to the fact that the research is still in the trial stage, there are still many problems in the practical application of many higher vocational colleges(HVC). Therefore, this paper puts forward the application research of AI in Higher Vocational ET mode. In this paper, the main problems and advantages of AI technology in ET are analyzed in depth. It is considered that the current reform has some typical problems, such as over reliance on multimedia, lack of innovation in multimedia teaching content, and no change in teaching thinking mode. In view of these problems, this paper puts forward the optimization and improvement measures, through the establishment of AI education platform and other means, to strengthen the intelligent work of English education. Based on the analysis of the changes of students and teachers in learning and teaching English according to AI, it is believed that because of the change of teaching methods, the ET in HVC has become much easier, and the students' interest in learning has also been greatly improved. The results of the survey on the implementation of AI cloud teaching further confirm that AI has great help for ET. This paper holds that accelerating the reform of modern education is a major development trend of education in the future, and AI plays an important role in this aspect. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  English Teaching;  Reform in Education;  Vocational EnglishDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusLi, F.57223036973;Information Teaching Platform of College Physical Education Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology(2021) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1852 (2), art. no. 022030, .

Existing Artificial Intelligence in Education (AiEd) technologies mostly used indirect methods to make the learning process efficient such as recommending contents based on difficulty adjustment, weakness analysis, learning theory, psychometric analysis, or domain specific rules. In this study, we propose a recommender system that optimizes the learning trajectory of a student preparing for a standardized exam by recommending the learning content(question) which directly maximizes the expected score after the consumption of the content. In particular, the proposed RCES model computes the expected score of a user by effectively capturing educational effects. To validate the proposed model in an end-to-end system, we conduct an A/B test on 1713 real students by deploying 4 recommenders to a real mobile application. Result shows that RCES has better educational efficiencies than traditional methods such as expert designed models and item response theory based models. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Education;  Intelligent tutoring system;  Personalized learning;  Recommender systemsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusBlease, C., Kharko, A., Annoni, M., Gaab, J., Locher, C.36558812800;57219411781;55337199900;6602110060;55839401900;Machine Learning in Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy Education: A Mixed Methods Pilot Survey of Postgraduate Students at a Swiss University(2021) Frontiers in Public Health, 9, art. no. 623088, .

Objective: This mixed methods pilot study aimed to explore postgraduate clinical psychology students' familiarity and formal exposure to topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) during their studies. Methods: In April-June 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods online survey using a convenience sample of 120 clinical psychology students enrolled in a two-year Masters' program at a Swiss University. Results: In total 37 students responded (response rate: 37/120, 31%). Among respondents, 73% (n = 27) intended to enter a mental health profession, and 97% reported that they had heard of the term “machine learning.” Students estimated 0.52% of their program would be spent on AI/ML education. Around half (46%) reported that they intended to learn about AI/ML as it pertained to mental health care. On 5-point Likert scale, students “moderately agreed” (median = 4) that AI/M should be part of clinical psychology/psychotherapy education. Qualitative analysis of students' comments resulted in four major themes on the impact of AI/ML on mental healthcare: (1) Changes in the quality and understanding of psychotherapy care; (2) Impact on patient-therapist interactions; (3) Impact on the psychotherapy profession; (4) Data management and ethical issues. Conclusions: This pilot study found that postgraduate clinical psychology students held a wide range of opinions but had limited formal education on how AI/ML-enabled tools might impact psychotherapy. The survey raises questions about how curricula could be enhanced to educate clinical psychology/psychotherapy trainees about the scope of AI/ML in mental healthcare. © Copyright © 2021 Blease, Kharko, Annoni, Gaab and Locher.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  attitudes;  ethics;  machine learning;  medical education psychotherapy education;  opinions;  psychology students;  surveyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusAihua, Z.57215129166;New Ecology of AI-Assisted Language Education(2021) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1861 (1), art. no. 012040, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104203477&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1861%2f1%2f012040&partnerID=40&md5=1792f290ff99f2dcccfb10de520e431bDOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1861/1/012040ABSTRACT: AI-Assisted education is building new ecology in education: less cost, more efficient and more equal.

Currently, however, computer science educators have been reluctant to teach AI to non-majors out of concern that the topic is too advanced. To fill this gap, we propose an AI and machine learning (ML) curriculum that is specifically designed for first-year students. In this paper, we describe our curriculum and show how it covers four key content areas: Core concepts, implementation details, limitations, and ethical considerations. We then share our experiences teaching our new curriculum to 174 randomly-selected Freshman students. Our results show that non-computer scientists can comprehend AI/ML concepts without being overwhelmed by the subject material. Specifically, we show that students can design, code, and deploy their own intelligent agents to solve problems, and that they understand the importance and value of learning about AI in a general-education course. © 2021 Public Domain.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  computer science education;  machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLee, I., Ali, S., Zhang, H., Dipaola, D., Breazeal, C.37049104500;57207448534;57203798086;57208863454;7003691791;Developing Middle School Students' AI Literacy(2021) SIGCSE 2021 - Proceedings of the 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 191-197.

The workshop featured the 30-hour "Developing AI Literacy"or DAILy curriculum that is grounded in literature on child development, ethics education, and career development. The participants in the workshop were students between the ages of 10 and 14; 87% were from underrepresented groups in STEM and Computing. In this paper we describe the online curriculum, its implementation during synchronous online workshop sessions in summer of 2020, and preliminary findings on student outcomes. We reflect on the successes and lessons we learned in terms of supporting students' engagement and conceptual learning of AI, shifting attitudes toward AI, and fostering conceptions of future selves as AI-enabled workers. We conclude with discussions of the affordances and barriers to bringing AI education to students from underrepresented groups in STEM and Computing. © 2021 Owner/Author.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: computational thinking;  computing education;  machine learning educationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusOttenbreit-Leftwich, A., Glazewski, K., Jeon, M., Hmelo-Silver, C., Mott, B., Lee, S., Lester, J.26656093500;24436207800;57222583513;6507383226;57203231751;36194869400;57203179695;How do Elementary Students Conceptualize Artificial Intelligence?(2021) SIGCSE 2021 - Proceedings of the 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, p. 1261.

For example, the Chinese education ministry has integrated AI into the mandatory high school curriculum, including a pilot textbook to teach students about the fundamental AI technologies like deep learning and recognition. However, there are fewer examples of AI education at the primary level, and these are typically focused on decision-making, machine learning, and programming. We have recently started to develop our own elementary AI curriculum. To develop the curriculum, we first needed to explore what students already knew about AI. Although there are a few small studies on how primary students conceptualize AI, we conducted a study to examine how 10 nine- A nd ten-year-old students conceptualized artificial intelligence by focusing on two main questions: (1) How do elementary students conceptualize artificial intelligence? (2) What are elementary students' experiences with artificial intelligence? Students? definitions of AI tended to focus on programming and robotics. Students described examples of AI that included robotic vacuums, Siri/Alexa, YouTube, and search engines. They also showcased some misconceptions around AI designs and implementations. © 2021 Owner/Author.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  elementary education;  perceptionsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusRodríguez-Garciá, J.D., Moreno-León, J., Román-González, M., Robles, G.57216975938;56912229700;57188680243;8286496000;Evaluation of an Online Intervention to Teach Artificial Intelligence with LearningML to 10-16-Year-Old Students(2021) SIGCSE 2021 - Proceedings of the 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 177-183.

That is why we have developed LearningML, aiming to provide a platform that supports educators and students in the creation of hands-on AI projects, specifically based on machine learning techniques. In this investigation we explore how a workshop on AI and the creation of programming projects with LearningML impacts the knowledge on AI of students between 10 and 16 years. 135 participants completed all phases of the learning experience, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic had to be performed online. In order to assess the AI knowledge we created a test that includes different kinds of questions based on previous investigations and publications-resulting in a reliable assessment instrument. Our findings show that the initiative had a positive impact on participants? AI knowledge, being the enhancement especially important for those learners who initially showed less familiarity with the topic. We observe, for instance, that while previous ideas on AI revolve around the term robot, after the experience they do around solve and problem. Based on these results we suggest that LearningML can be seen as a promising platform for the teaching and learning of AI in K-12 environments. In addition, researchers and educators can make use of the new instrument we provide to evaluate future educational interventions. © 2021 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  assessment;  computational thinking;  K-12;  machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusRaji, I.D., Scheuerman, M.K., Amironesei, R.57206671199;57194287652;57193760184;"you can't sit with us": Exclusionary pedagogy in AI ethics education(2021) FAccT 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, art. no. 3445914, pp. 515-525.

However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of "exclusionary pedagogy,"where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as "ethical unicorns"that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited. Through an analysis of computer science education literature and a review of college-level course syllabi in AI ethics, we discuss the limitations of the epistemological assumptions and hierarchies of knowledge which dictate current attempts at including ethics education in CS training and explore evidence for the practical mechanisms through which this exclusion occurs. We then propose a shift towards a substantively collaborative, holistic, and ethically generative pedagogy in AI education. © 2021 ACM.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusGil, W.-J., Kim, J.-W., Park, K.-R., Cho, H.-J.57225109348;57209835696;16643651100;57195522630;An Analysis of Research Trends in AI Education based on LDA(2021) Review of International Geographical Education Online, 11 (2), pp. 254-262.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109126807&doi=10.33403%2frigeo.800456&partnerID=40&md5=2c1cedd155dfe29d73f6653aec943af9DOI: 10.33403/rigeo.800456ABSTRACT: AI thinking-based education that automatically learns rules and meanings not based on procedural thinking but based on adaptation and cognition as a framework is attracting higher attention. Many studies on “AI Thinking” based on algorithms and logical thinking are actively conducted based on the computing thinking proposed for software education purposes. In this article, specifically on what topics and in which fields the studies on AI education are conducted was examined, and in which forms such studies are utilized was examined as well. To understand the topic of the articles on “Artificial Intelligence Education”, such articles were analyzed using topic modeling techniques. To do so, a total of 1,258 articles were collected by retrieving the keyword “Artificial Intelligence Education” from the Korean academic articles provided by the Research Information Sharing Service (RISS). Of the automatically collected articles, those that were off topic were removed, and a total of 1,045 articles were finally selected as the analysis targets. Based on the analysis results acquired using the LDA, a representative algorithm of topic modeling, 8 topics were finally selected as the optimal classification standards, and the title per detailed topic was determined based on the keywords per topic. This study is expected to help teachers establish their AI education learning and research direction. The future study should be aimed at implementing web services to automate and generalize all processes. © 2021AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  AI Education;  NLP;  Text Mining;  Topic ModelingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusTran, K., Nguyen, T.57222521750;57220125738;Preliminary research on the social attitudes toward the ai’s involved christian education in vietnam: Promoting ai technology for religious education(2021) Religions, 12 (3), art. no. 208, pp. 1-20.

However, there is little empirical research on the readiness, acceptance, and adoption of religious education involvement of AI in a secular state such as Vietnam. This research addresses the literature gap by providing an entrepreneurial analysis and customer perspectives on the ideas of AI involvement in religious education. Specifically, the study explores whether the Vietnamese across different ages accept and have enough skills to adopt AI in Christian education innovation. The interview sample is 32 participants, selected based on their religious orientation (Christians and non-Christians) and age (Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z). Most respondents are open to AI application in religious education except for Church personnel. However, only Generation Z are fully prepared to adopt this innovation. Theoretically, the research customizes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model into religious innovation context. Practically, this research acts as market research on the demand for AI’s religious innovation in Vietnam, an insight for future religious tech entrepreneurs. © 2021 by the authors.

Materials and methods: The proposed curriculum consists of two levels: Basic (introducing MPs to the pillars of knowledge, development and applications of AI, in the context of medical imaging and radiation therapy) and Advanced. Both are common to the subspecialties (diagnostic and interventional radiology, nuclear medicine, and radiation oncology). The learning outcomes of the training are presented as knowledge, skills and competences (KSC approach). Results: For the Basic section, KSCs were stratified in four subsections: (1) Medical imaging analysis and AI Basics; (2) Implementation of AI applications in clinical practice; (3) Big data and enterprise imaging, and (4) Quality, Regulatory and Ethical Issues of AI processes. For the Advanced section instead, a common block was proposed to be further elaborated by each subspecialty core curriculum. The learning outcomes were also translated into a syllabus of a more traditional format, including practical applications. Conclusions: This AI curriculum is the first attempt to create a guideline expanding the current educational framework for Medical Physicists in Europe. It should be considered as a document to top the sub-specialties’ curriculums and adapted by national training and regulatory bodies. The proposed educational program can be implemented via the European School of Medical Physics Expert (ESMPE) course modules and – to some extent – also by the national competent EFOMP organizations, to reach widely the medical physicist community in Europe. © 2021 Associazione Italiana di Fisica MedicaAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Continuing professional development (CPD);  Education and training;  EFOMP;  Medical physicistDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusWong, K., Gallant, F., Szumacher, E.57220858271;57450495600;6603386517;Perceptions of Canadian radiation oncologists, radiation physicists, radiation therapists and radiation trainees about the impact of artificial intelligence in radiation oncology – national survey(2021) Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences, 52 (1), pp. 44-48.

While this field continues to evolve, there is no clear understanding about how radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, medical physicists and radiation trainees perceive AI and its’ impact on radiation oncology as a discipline. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception of these four Canadian professional groups about AI. and how AI will affect radiation oncology as a specialty. Methods: Following an in-depth scientific review of the existing literature, a 29 Likert-scale questionnaire was developed using Google Survey. The questionnaire was piloted and distributed through national organizations including the Canadian Association for Radiation Oncology (CARO), the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Therapy (CAMRT) and the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists (COMP), initially in February, and again between March and June 2020. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: 159 responses were received from 10 Canadian provinces. Knowledge about AI was moderate with an average of 5/10, but 91% responded interest in learning more about it. The negative implications of AI were related to fear of losing jobs and shift of practice. The majority of participants agreed AI would positively impact on patient treatment. Conclusion: Radiation oncology professionals believe AI will be an important part of patient treatment in their future practices. The fear about AI may be mitigated with further education programs about AI, which can gain more confidence in the acceptance of AI. © 2020AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Big data;  Education;  Forecasting;  Machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSchiff, D.57209302629;Out of the laboratory and into the classroom: the future of artificial intelligence in education(2021) AI and Society, 36 (1), pp. 331-348.

However, unlike frequently discussed applications of AI in autonomous vehicles, military and cybersecurity concerns, and healthcare, AI’s impacts on education policy and practice have not yet captured the public’s attention. This paper, therefore, evaluates the status of AIEd, with special attention to intelligent tutoring systems and anthropomorphized artificial educational agents. I discuss AIEd’s purported capacities, including the abilities to simulate teachers, provide robust student differentiation, and even foster socio-emotional engagement. Next, to situate developmental pathways for AIEd going forward, I contrast sociotechnical possibilities and risks through two idealized futures. Finally, I consider a recent proposal to use peer review as a gatekeeping strategy to prevent harmful research. This proposal serves as a jumping off point for recommendations to AIEd stakeholders towards improving their engagement with socially responsible research and implementation of AI in educational systems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Education technology;  Educational agents;  Responsible research and innovation;  Social implications of technologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Bronze, GreenSOURCE: ScopusHou, Z.57222295096;Research on Adopting Artificial Intelligence Technology to Improve Effectiveness of Vocational College English Learning(2021) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1744 (4), art. no. 042122, .

Due to the singularity of teaching methods and the lack of effective student self-learning platform, many students consider that English learning is boring and the actual learning effect is poor[1-2]. As an emerging edge discipline, artificial intelligence covers a series of topics such as image recognition, pattern recognition, robotics, natural language understanding and expert systems. The simulation and application of human language intelligence is an essential progress of artificial intelligence technology[3].

These two X-linked disorders are characterized by nystagmus, color vision defect, myopia, and electroretinography (ERG) abnormalities. Ocular hypopigmentation and iris transillumination are reported only in patients with Åland island eye disease. Around 260 variants were reported to be associated with these two non-progressive disorders, with 19 specific to Åland island eye disease and 14 associated with both Åland island eye disease and incomplete congenital stationary night blindness. CACNA1F variants spread on the gene and further analysis are needed to reveal phenotype-genotype correlation. Case Report: A complete ocular exam and genetic testing were performed on a 13-year-old boy. A novel splice-site variant, c.4294-11C>G in intron 36 in CACNA1F, was identified at hemizygous state in the patient and at heterozygous state in his asymptomatic mother and explained the phenotype synonymous with Åland island eye disease and incomplete congenital stationary night blindness observed in the patient. Conclusion: We present a novel variant in the CACNA1F gene causing phenotypic and electrophysiologic findings indistinguishable from those of AIED/CSNB2A disease. This finding further expands the mutational spectrum and our knowledge of CACNA1F-related disease. © 2021 by the authors.

Today, information technology is increasingly being used to alleviate this problem by bridging the gap between learners and the textual materials by automating the process of teaching and learning. Due to this, there has been a steep rise in the information need for pedagogical content in recent years. Although there is increasing interest in building question-answering systems, there is a scarcity of intelligent tutoring systems, particularly, in physics education that can aid both students and teachers in secondary education. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multi-label classification of paragraphs, where the paragraphs are chosen from physics subject of 6th to 12th grades from the curriculum of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), India. This curriculum is common across India. For this purpose, we have constructed an attention-based recurrent interleaved multi-task learning (MTL) network, namely InPHYNet that can be used for any general purpose multi-label classification task related to the educational domain. The proposed solution is contextual and scalable. Although related to physics education, it is generalizable as an approach for other subjects. We perform experiments (i) to verify and validate the labels of data collected, and (ii) to conduct robust analysis of the proposed InPHYNet network. It is observed to yield significant accuracy on the dataset and can be used for any education-based text classification/annotation or as a module within the educational question-answering systems to enhance its quality. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in physics education;  Architectures for educational technology system;  Attention-based multitask recurrent network;  Multi-label classificationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusJoshi, S., Rambola, R.K., Churi, P.57212646143;57205626852;57188831747;Evaluating artificial intelligence in education for next generation(2021) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1714 (1), art. no. 012039, .

Artificial intelligence is a thriving technology to transform all aspects of our social interaction. In education, AI will now develop new teaching and learning solutions that will be tested in different situations. Educational goals can be better achieved and managed by new educational technologies. First, this paper analyses how AI can use to improve outcomes in teaching, providing examples of how technology AI can help educators use data to enhance fairness and rank of education in developing countries. This study aims to examine teacher's and student's perceptions of the use and effectiveness of AI in education. Its curse and perceived as a good education system and human knowledge. The optimistic use of AI in class is strongly recommended by teachers and students. But every teacher is more adapted to new technological changes than students. Further research on generational and geographical diversity on perceptions of teachers and students can contribute to the more effective implementation of AI in Education (AIED). © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Serious health issues also mean increased absence and additional lags in academic achievement and development of adaptive and social skills. The incorporation of artificial intelligence in the education of a child with ID/DD could ameliorate the educational, adaptive and social skill gaps that occur as a direct result of persistent health problems. Design/methodology/approach: The literature regarding the use of artificial intelligence in education for students with ID/DD was collected systematically from international online databases based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The collected articles were analyzed deductively, looking for the different gaps in the domain. Based on the literature, an artificial intelligence–based architecture is proposed and sketched. Findings: The findings show that there are many gaps in supporting students with ID/DD through the utilization of artificial intelligence. Given that the majority of students with ID/DD often have serious and chronic and comorbid health conditions, the potential use of health information in artificial intelligence is even more critical. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop a system that facilitates communication and access to health information for students with ID/DD, one that provides information to caregivers and education providers, limits errors, and, therefore, improves these individuals' education and quality of life. Practical implications: This review highlights the gap in the current literature regarding using artificial intelligence in supporting the education of students with ID/DD. There is an urgent need for an intelligent system in collaboration with the updated health information to improve the quality of services submitted for people with intellectual disabilities and as a result improving their quality of life. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the gaps in incorporating artificial intelligence and its service to individuals with ID/DD. The research additionally proposes a solution based on the confounding variables of students’ health and individual characteristics. This solution will provide an automated information flow as a functional diagnostic and intervention tool for teachers, caregivers and parents. It could potentially improve the educational and practical outcomes for individuals with ID/DD and, ultimately, their quality of life. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive skills;  Artificial intelligence;  Developmental/intellectual disabilities;  Edu-health intelligent system;  Education advisory system;  Health informationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusBozkurt, A., Karadeniz, A., Baneres, D., Guerrero-Roldán, A.E., Rodríguez, M.E.56566181600;54953963000;6506966079;26030330200;7401953622;Artificial intelligence and reflections from educational landscape: A review of AI studies in half a century(2021) Sustainability (Switzerland), 13 (2), art. no. 800, pp. 1-16.

The educational drone fills this characteristic, and it also accords with the demands of the market. It is supported that the users usually program and control the educational drone by means of graphical programming. However, it is relatively cumbersome to implement Artificial Intelligence algorithms in educational drone. It is difficult to understand and use intelligent methods for children. This paper introduces a graphical intelligent algorithm development platform that adopts the Scratch graphical programming language and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Firstly, we proposed an implementation architecture with three parts. Secondly, we use visual graphical programming to build and learn Artificial Intelligence methods and models. Finally, the target detection function of educational drone is treated as an example to prove the effectiveness of the proposed platform. The paper proposed a new development tool for the AI-educational drone. It will promote the application of the AI into the education of children. The platform adopts a combination of front and back ends, using back-end servers for algorithm implementation and neural network training and testing. © 2021 IEEEAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligent;  educational drone;  graphical programming;  object detectionDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMandlazi, J., Jadhav, A., Ajoodha, R.57493569000;22956239200;57188702634;Evaluating Deep Sequential Knowledge Tracing Models for Predicting Student Performance(2021) 2021 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering, CSDE 2021, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127898921&doi=10.1109%2fCSDE53843.2021.9718405&partnerID=40&md5=fd3d7cfae62e7d7cb241a312a549445cDOI: 10.1109/CSDE53843.2021.9718405ABSTRACT: One of the key priorities in all instructional environments is to ensure that students recognise their learning mechanisms and pathways. Knowledge Tracing (KT), the task of modelling student knowledge from their learning history, is an important problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and has numerous applications in the development of interactive and adaptive learning technologies. KT can be utilised to understand each student's distinct learning style, particular needs, and ability levels. We trained and evaluated the performance of Knowledge Tracing models on the ASSISTments dataset and EdNet-KT1 dataset. This study revealed that deep learning models for knowledge tracing (Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN), and Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT)) outperform the Markov process model (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing). We also observed that AKT and DKT go hand in hand with predicting whether or not the following question will be answered correctly or incorrectly by the student. © IEEE 2022.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence in Education;  Knowledge TracingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSchrumpf, J., Weber, F., Thelen, T.57218998668;57214718854;56505257200;A Neural Natural Language Processing System for Educational Resource Knowledge Domain Classification(2021) Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI), Proceedings - Series of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI), P-316, pp. 283-288.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127381721&partnerID=40&md5=7d782350ae528d4ad9fcde90b4fab392ABSTRACT: In higher education, educational resources are the vessel with which information get transferred to the learner. Information on the content discussed in the scope of the educational resources, however, is implicit and must be inferred by the user by reading the resource title or through contextual information. In this paper we present a state-of-the-art neural natural language processing system, based on Google-BERT, that maps educational resource titles into one of 905 classes from the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system. We present model architecture, training procedure dataset properties and our performance analysis methodology. We show that aside from classification performance, our model implicitly learns the class hierarchy inherent to the DDC. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

This aspect gives to AI the status of a central pole in the process of digital transformation of society. The impact of AI on the Education sector is particularly visible: differentiated and individualized learning, automatic admin tasks, tutoring and support outside the classroom, automatic translators etc. In such a context, the approach to the study of the basics of AI in school becomes strictly necessary. Our students need to learn what is AI and how it will change the world we live in, what is Machine Learning (ML), what means Computer Vision (CV), how facial analysis and voice recognition systems work etc. In order to teach Science through the STEM educational model, we initiated optional school courses in Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics and AI (approached through ML). In this article we presented a method of approaching and implementing, in the school educational environment, the concept of Machine Learning. In this sense, we have realized, on the Arduino platform, two IoT projects based on this concept: Speech Recognition and Facial Recognition. In the first of these projects, Speech Recognition, we used the EasyVR 3 Plus module. This is a speech recognition module that has been designed to add robust voice recognition capabilities to almost any application. The range of applications made with this module includes voice control for home automation, robots voice control etc. After assembling the components of the kit that contains the module, we proceeded to its functional testing. Through the associated application (EasyVR Commander) we created a group of users who received usernames and passwords. Using ML algorithms, the system was trained in voice recognition of usernames and passwords. The system, based on voice interactivity, reacts to the recognition of a user's voice allowing the control of the status of an LED and the rotation of a servomotor. For the second project, Facial Recognition, we used the ESP-32 CAM module. This module is widely used in IoT applications, such as: wireless video monitoring, QR wireless identification, facial recognition etc. We tested this module functionally first as a video monitoring device and then as a facial identification system. Based on ML algorithms, the software of this device detects the human faces in front of the camera, stores information about them and is trained in their recognition. The project was implemented as an automatic door unlock system after the face of the person in front of the camera was recognized. © 2021, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

In education, AI is being used to improve educational processes. UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium, but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational thinking and critical thinking. The present Systematic Literature Review was developed according to the methodological guidelines proposed by Barbara Kitchenham, with the objective of identifying how AI teaching-learning processes are carried out from early ages. Sixty-four studies were obtained between 2016-2021, where eleven countries are identified with AI teaching initiatives, through workshops, courses and projects to update their curricula; machine learning and educational robotics are the two branches linked to AI that are currently taught to children and adolescents. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: educational informatics;  high school;  learning experience;  primary education;  teaching practices.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusViraktamath, S.V., Sajjanar, T.P., Angadi, A.A., Nabhapur, S.S., Sunanda, G.6507985802;57542272900;57544416700;57542273000;57542995100;The Impact of Mixed Reality in Education System-the Classroom Environment(2021) 2021 International Conference on Circuits, Controls and Communications, CCUBE 2021, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126903210&doi=10.1109%2fCCUBE53681.2021.9702735&partnerID=40&md5=b23aef74ac090814cf9567ccb5d11fc6DOI: 10.1109/CCUBE53681.2021.9702735ABSTRACT: In the mysterious realm full of emerging technologies, there is a fantastic role played by Mixed Reality techniques. The blending of real and virtual worlds that allows individualized user control opportunities of the environment around user remarks the unique feature of Mixed Reality. The current work shows the effort of many researchers who have tried to explore the field of Mixed Reality in their own planned ways for the creation of Mixed Reality smart classroom. The objective is to introduce, how Mixed Reality device can act as real-time analytical tool for the teacher in a classroom to enhance the learning process of the students. The first part introduces the advent of Mixed Reality with some defined theories that are widely accepted and a glimpse of approaches done by many researchers. Later, an overview of an attempt to create a Mixed Reality classroom, two different hypotheses incorporating the same Mixed Reality tool called Lumilo were experimented with the assistance of AIED and ITS systems. Followed by the results of the hypotheses, aiming one of them to be employed in the classroom environment where both teachers and students were most benefitted. This type of environment resulted in better modes of education when compared to the existing approaches of Mixed Reality classroom. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Causal Alignment Analysis (CAA);  Head Mounted Displays (HMDs);  Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM);  Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS);  Lumilo;  Mixed reality (MR)DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLi, S.57226448710;Research on the Exploration and Reflection of Foreign Language Teaching Based on 'Artificial Intelligence + Education' in the Big Data Era(2021) Proceedings - 2021 2nd International Conference on Big Data Economy and Information Management, BDEIM 2021, pp. 354-357.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126869033&doi=10.1109%2fBDEIM55082.2021.00078&partnerID=40&md5=c799cb8c7908ed47dd369e0863aaf088DOI: 10.1109/BDEIM55082.2021.00078ABSTRACT: In the Big Data era, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education filed today, innovate teaching and learning practices, and thus accelerate the progress to digital education. Traditional foreign language teaching focuses more on traditional teaching methods, for instance, Grammar Translation, Direct Method in the classroom; however, with the emergence of artificial intelligence in education, innovative teaching and learning such as mobile learning occur, which allows teaching and learning take place outside the classroom. This paper aims to investigate the application of AI into foreign language teaching, which takes College English Teaching as an example. The development of AI in education, mobile learning, big data, blended learning, flipped classrooms, and smart learning platforms is introduced as literature review, and then the design and application of AI into FLT, to be specific, College English Teaching is outlined to illustrate the implementation of AI in education. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence(AI);  Big Data;  Foreign Language Teaching (FLT);  Mobile Learning;  Smart LearningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusZia, A., Nouri, J., Afzaal, M., Wu, Y., Li, X., Weegar, R.57257853100;36608737900;57222307128;57257970000;57258078100;56462951100;An Ensemble Approach for Question-Level Knowledge Tracing(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12749 LNAI, pp. 433-437.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126788969&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78270-2_77&partnerID=40&md5=0ce82739bb65a69916f76f4eac9a8310DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_77ABSTRACT: Knowledge tracing—where a machine models the students’ knowledge as they interact with coursework—is a well-established area in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education. In this paper, an ensemble approach is proposed that addresses existing limitations in question-centric knowledge tracing and achieves the goal of predicting future question correctness. The proposed approach consists of two models; one is Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) built by incorporating all relevant key features engineered from the data. The second model is a Multiheaded-Self-Attention Knowledge Tracing model (MSAKT) that extracts historical student knowledge of future question by calculating their contextual similarity with previously attempted questions. The proposed model’s effectiveness is evaluated by conducting experiments on a big Kaggle dataset achieving an Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) score of 0.84 with 84% accuracy using 10fold cross-validation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive learning;  Artificial Intelligence;  Intelligent education;  Knowledge tracing;  Question-level predictionDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusElsayed, A.57539820900;Science Centers as an Essential Tool for AI Pre-College Education in Developing Countries(2021) 2021 IEEE Global Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, GCAIoT 2021, pp. 94-99.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126788220&doi=10.1109%2fGCAIoT53516.2021.9692949&partnerID=40&md5=98cf4449adc5cbfd02c36e62f0c7a2cbDOI: 10.1109/GCAIoT53516.2021.9692949ABSTRACT: Despite cultural and social variation between different communities, science centers provide motivating and enriching environments for learning. Immediate impact can be exciting, but the long-term effects on learning and motivation are more significant, especially while including AI related programs. Due to many problems that are facing formal educational systems, especially in developing countries, informal education is expected to complement the formal system, mainly with technological fields, at an affordable price. The long-term impact is to get students involved in science as a lifelong learning process outside the classroom, and expected to result in creating the critical mass of youth who are interested in S&T. Moreover, changing the culture of entrepreneurship and youth to be scientific oriented and educational focused is crucial in upgrading the quality of the regional potential HR. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Center;  Education;  Museum;  Robotics;  Science;  TechnologyDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusCloude, E.B., Ballelos, N.A.M., Azevedo, R., Castiglioni, A., LaRochelle, J., Andrews, A., Hernandez, C.57202432970;57540158500;18036509700;15847737400;24721625300;55583386400;55880932800;Designing Intelligent Systems to Support Medical Diagnostic Reasoning Using Process Data(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12749 LNAI, pp. 109-113.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126785243&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78270-2_19&partnerID=40&md5=61f636d78dca62fb343bfcbfd4cb62afDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_19ABSTRACT: We captured 36 medical professionals’ process data across five medical cases using CResME, a multimedia system designed to activate illness scripts.

There is also a growing and broad concern about the ways that personal data is harvested and used. This makes it timely to draw on the decades of AIED research towards creating systems and interfaces that enable learners to truly harness and control their learning data. This invited keynote will present a whirlwind tour of my learner modelling research and a selection of other work that has influenced my own towards the goal of putting people in control of their own learning data and its use. I will explain the rationale for my focus on scrutability, as a foundation for users to harness and control their learning data, especially for learning contexts. I will share key lessons from my work for creating AIED systems that are deeply learner centred. Building on this, I will present a vision for AIED, one that takes a learner-centred perspective to designing AIED systems and recognises the inherent limitations of learning data. This is a broad view of AIED that returns its founding goals to create advanced learning technologies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AIED;  Holistic design;  Human-computer interaction;  Learner models;  Personalised learning systems;  Scrutability;  Software engineering;  User control;  User-centred designDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKhazanchi, R.57221784662;Impact of Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) on Mathematics Achievement Using ALEKS(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12749 LNAI, pp. 471-475.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126740102&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78270-2_83&partnerID=40&md5=2acabc6104e8e1c439a5aab65bf89fdaDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_83ABSTRACT: This doctoral research will explore the Impact of the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), such as the Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS), on students’ mathematics achievement, affective engagement, and cognitive engagement on 9th-grade students from two different school districts with somewhat similar demographics.

Built-in capabilities for conducting complicated computer operations (edge computing), cloud-based services for collaboratively addressing difficult issues, access to huge quantities of open and closed data resources, and conciliatory accession for agile network connections are all available on these low-cost devices. Education is helped by AI in at least two ways: (1) the educational process - assistance and modifications to pedagogy and educator's routine function; and (2) the educational ambit and content - what kind of education is needed. Author, in this article, explores the challenges and potentialities that AI offers in the field of education. While the focus is on AI's participation, it may be difficult to differentiate it from other technological advancements, especially when it comes to work life. Author conclude that AI (and associated technological advancements) will substitute some professions (didactics will not be required), that other professions will transform impressively (didactic materials will need to be updated), and that a significant number of novel vocations will be created (new-fangled didactics must be constituted). In educational operations - the task itself - AI will be a reformer as well as a facilitator, altering the characteristics and division of labor. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Educational Technology;  Expert Systems;  ICT in Education;  Intelligent Systems;  Machine Learning;  TeachingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusXu, S., Xu, G., Jia, P., Ding, W., Wu, Z., Liu, Z.57218283750;57209505721;57226337426;57207458619;57221862355;56101750800;Automatic Task Requirements Writing Evaluation via Machine Reading Comprehension(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12748 LNAI, pp. 446-458.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126465347&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78292-4_36&partnerID=40&md5=77100bb3ae48703b889d04d494de5849DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-78292-4_36ABSTRACT: Task requirements (TRs) writing is an important question type in Key English Test and Preliminary English Test. A TR writing question may include multiple requirements and a high-quality essay must respond to each requirement thoroughly and accurately. However, the limited teacher resources prevent students from getting detailed grading instantly. The majority of existing automatic essay scoring systems focus on giving a holistic score but rarely provide reasons to support it. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end framework based on machine reading comprehension (MRC) to address this problem to some extent. The framework not only detects whether an essay responds to a requirement question, but clearly marks where the essay answers the question. Our framework consists of three modules: question normalization module, ELECTRA based MRC module and response locating module. We extensively explore state-of-the-art MRC methods. Our approach achieves 0.93 accuracy score and 0.85 F1 score on a real-world educational dataset.

The study's focus was restricted to the use and impact of artificial intelligence in administration, education, and learning, and was founded on a narrative and framework created via exploratory research for assessing AI. The use of literature review as a research strategy and methodology helped in accomplishment of study's goal, which was achieved making use of a qualitative research technique. AI is an area of research in which computers, robots, and other technologies are programmed to exhibit human-like intelligence, as characterised by cognitive skills such as learning and adaptation, as well as decision-making capabilities. According to the findings, AI has been widely embraced and used in a number of ways by organisations, especially educational institutions, in a range of circumstances and settings. AI began with computer technology, progressed to intelligent online and web-based education, and finally, embedded computer systems were used to perform instructional tasks autonomously or collaboratively with teachers, in conjunction with other technologies such as humanoid robots and web-based chatbots. These platforms have allowed instructors to improve the overall quality of their instructional work while also improving their efficiency and speed for administrative duties such as evaluating students' work. However, since the systems are based on machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and materials can be customised to meet the unique requirements of individual students, resulting in improved absorption and retention and a more pleasant overall learning experience. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in Education;  Data Mining;  E-Learning;  Educational Technology;  Humanoid Robots;  Learning Analytics;  Machine LearningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusBaker, R.S., Nasiar, N., Ocumpaugh, J.L., Hutt, S., Andres, J.M.A.L., Slater, S., Schofield, M., Moore, A., Paquette, L., Munshi, A., Biswas, G.8967971100;57209024096;55255149400;57195276908;57190029869;57193204958;57525464500;35318323300;35262509400;57203428953;57211726890;Affect-Targeted Interviews for Understanding Student Frustration(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12748 LNAI, pp. 52-63.

In particular, it remains unclear how students’ perceptions about the learning activity drive their experience of frustration and their subsequent choices during learning. In this paper, we adopt a mixed-methods approach, using automated detectors of affect to signal classroom researchers to interview a specific student at a specific time. We hand-code the interviews using grounded theory, then distill particularly common associations between interview codes and affective patterns. We find common patterns involving student perceptions of difficulty, system helpfulness, and strategic behavior, and study them in greater depth. We find, for instance, that the experience of difficulty produces shifts from engaged concentration to frustration that lead students to adopt a variety of problem-solving strategies.

The aim of this VR application is to experience a negotiation situation in the form of a pitch and to learn to apply an ideally optimal negotiation style in a highly competitive sales negotiation for capital goods. The user slips into the role of the seller and uses natural language to negotiate with two virtual, AI-controlled agents acting in the role of two professional buyers. The VR application motivates the repetition and consolidation of the learning content by incorporating playful elements and creating a serious game environment [1]. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence (AI);  combination of VR and AI;  digital education with VR and AI;  training simulation;  virtual negotiation training;  Virtual reality (VR)DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMccall, F., Hussein, A., Petraki, E., Elsawah, S., Abbass, H.57227054400;57204830026;55963740200;36682211400;6701824380;Towards a systematic educational framework for human-machine teaming(2021) TALE 2021 - IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Education, Proceedings, pp. 375-382.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125939802&doi=10.1109%2fTALE52509.2021.9678853&partnerID=40&md5=90869cc6508dfb80fb4316b8b5b4bf6dDOI: 10.1109/TALE52509.2021.9678853ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are having a great impact on all aspects of society. However, due to the technical competencies and mathematical understanding required for implementing solutions leveraging these technologies, access to the communities working on these technologies is limited to those having these skills. This limits the ability of domain experts to directly transfer their knowledge and contribute to the development of AI and ML systems. To address this problem, we propose the Human Education AI Teaming (HEAT) framework, in which we draw on human education to design an innovative education system to enable collaboration between humans and AI cognitive agents. The main aim of HEAT is to promote the social integration of AI by allowing domain experts to focus more on communicating a body of knowledge to the machine, and less on the computational, data, and engineering concepts associated with how the machine learns. We follow an educational theory-driven approach to derive the content knowledge and competencies required by each agent. We conclude the paper with a demonstration case study explaining how the complex autonomous guidance of a flock of sheep could leverage HEAT to make the technology accessible by empowering non-AI specialists, livestock farmers in our example. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: curriculum development;  human-machine teaming;  instructional design;  machine education;  machine teachingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMarxer, R., Hugel, V., Prud'Homme, K.P., Batista, P., Aviles, J.V.M., Pascoal, A., Sanz, P.J., Schjolberg, I.24335757500;6603367879;57479773100;22956950800;55355448500;7004025535;7102001752;6506434226;Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR)(2021) Oceans Conference Record (IEEE), 2021-September, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125925468&doi=10.23919%2fOCEANS44145.2021.9706122&partnerID=40&md5=5e2ba46d4e9bc4de9eb8dd0331500e71DOI: 10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9706122ABSTRACT: Exploring the oceans, much like space, requires innovative solutions and new technology. The growing demand to protect, exploit and learn about some of our most precious resources calls for particular knowledge and skills to respond to the challenges of a harsh and unforgiving environment. The new Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree (EMJMD) Programme in Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR) (http://www.master-mir.eu) combines robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance marine and maritime science and its technological applications. It aims at building the capacity to enable advances in far reaching sea exploration, autonomous deep sea robots, teleoperations and the use of AI in these endeavours. The MIR programme is shaped to provide training in data science and state of the art applied robotics targeted at enhancing the efficiency, health, safety and environmental performance of the offshore industry and maritime operations. The EMJMD MIR programme offers competitive scholarships to welcome students worldwide and provides them with a common space to develop their shared passion for marine robotics and AI. The programme fosters cultural exchange and sharing of individual experiences. The master's is conducted by a consortium of 4 well-established academic institutions in the domain of marine robotics research. The institutions are in 4 countries France (UTLN), Norway (NTNU), Portugal (UL-IST) and Spain (UJI), for which the ocean has played a key role in history and is anchored in society. The goal of the programme is to develop specialists in marine and maritime intelligent robotic systems, providing them with: a) a solid theoretical background in the marine physical processes and technical skills in robotics engineering control systems and sensors, b) grounded knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, enabling them to develop cutting edge robotics solutions to real world challenges, c) applied knowledge in subsea and maritime application fields, including blue growth of maritime and offshore sectors, as well as deep sea surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, subsea resources exploration, offshore structure maintenance, e-navigation and maritime security enhancement.Students completing the MIR Masters will be well equipped with skills and state of the art knowledge, enabling them to pursue a career in robotics engineering for the offshore oil and gas, renewable, naval, and maritime sectors. Additionally, the knowledge acquired in the use and function of intelligent robotics for the underwater environment will enable them to easily continue on to a PhD in multiple different fields, should they so desire.The programme was designed to address global challenges identified by the consortium, the gap between industry and academia, the slow convergence of AI and robotics communities and the geopolitical and cultural differences among participating countries. The MIR programme contains a growing worldwide network of more than 58 academic and industrial associate partners spanning more than 21 counmes and covering all oceans. Associate partners participate by providing industry-led lectures, internships, research collaborations and scholarships. Learning-by-doing courses cover the fundamentals of the marine environment, robotics and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the interconnections between these fields. A set of transversal skills is developed through courses in languages, scientific writing and entrepreneurship. Furthermore. the MIR consortium organises a yearly symposium hosting presentations from the students' work, keynotes from distinguished scholars, industry representatives and competitive challenges in AI and robotics.While the first year of the course takes place at UTLN, each student specialises in one of the three study tracks, encompassing a 3rd semester at one of the other main partners' institutions. Applied robotics for underwater intervention missions (UJI) aims to endow underwater robots with the capability to interact with the environment using manipulators, thus paving the way for the development of advanced systems for close-range underwater infrastructures inspection and maintenance as well as materials sampling. Safe Autonomous subsea operations (NTNU) targets increasing the level of automation and autonomy in routine or otherwise tedious operations which can improve safety, efficiency and performance, supporting the human operator in decision-making and supervision and reducing human workload. Cooperative marine robotics for scientific and commercial applications (IST-UL) focuses on groups of autonomous marine robots working in cooperation, networked via aerial, acoustic, and optical links to dramatically improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales.MIR students write a master thesis related to their study track and supervised by one of the main partners and their work is presented at the MIR annual symposium. Graduates receive a double diploma from UTLN and the institution of their study track. The MIR programme fills a gap in the current EU education landscape by responding to a pressing demand for specialists in ocean technology. It does so by building a consortium of actors around the globe with the common goal of advancing education and research in AI and robotics for ocean applications. © 2021 MTS.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusKarimi, H., Tang, J., Weiss, X., Huang, J.57204682086;56245477300;57468821600;34769924600;Automatic Identification of Teachers in Social Media using Positive Unlabeled Learning(2021) Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2021, pp. 643-652.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125360961&doi=10.1109%2fBigData52589.2021.9671476&partnerID=40&md5=71e7bdf1c3ddcd3825f9774133fa202cDOI: 10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671476ABSTRACT: With the emergence of online social media platforms, there has been a surge of teachers/educators turning to these platforms for professional purposes, e.g., supplementing their students' educational needs. Consequently, teachers in social media have been the subject of many educational studies. Despite the progress in this line of research, one of the major obstacles is the limited number of teachers being investigated. Current studies usually suffice to at most a few hundreds of surveyed teachers while there are thousands of other teachers online. To better understand teachers in online social media and enable modern machine learning approaches to process teacher-related data, we need to identify more teachers. Thus, this paper proposes a framework to automatically identify teachers on Pinterest- an image-based social media platform popular among teachers. We formulate the teacher identification problem as a positive unlabeled learning task where positive samples are a small set of surveyed teachers, and unlabeled samples are their connected users on Pinterest. We perform extensive experiments on a real dataset of teachers on Pinterest and show the effectiveness of our framework. We believe the proposed framework can potentially improve the quality of many research endeavors concerned with studying teachers in social media. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in Education;  Pinterest;  Positive Unlabeled Learning;  Social Media;  TeachersDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYousuf, M., Wahid, A.57190805715;57209486493;The role of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Current Trends and Future Prospects(2021) International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies: Applications, Trends and Opportunities, ICISCT 2021, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125057847&doi=10.1109%2fICISCT52966.2021.9670009&partnerID=40&md5=b068c4474107bf9b995d62e63765af00DOI: 10.1109/ICISCT52966.2021.9670009ABSTRACT: Today's education plays a vital role in an individual and a society's development.

However, and as it has been seen in other contexts, the integration of AI can have unforeseen consequences with detrimental effects which can result in unfair and discriminatory decisions. Therefore it is worth thinking about potential risks that learning environments integrating AI systems might pose. This work explores the intersections between AI, online learning, and ethics in order to understand the ethical concerns surrounding this crossroads. We review the main ethical challenges identified in the literature and distill a set of guidelines to support the ethical design and integration of AI systems in online learning environments. This should help ensure that online learning is how is meant to be: accessible, inclusive, fair, and beneficial to society. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, what is learned about students in one system—their skills, behaviors, and affect—is not carried over to other systems that could benefit students by using the information, potentially reducing both the effectiveness and efficiency of these systems. This challenge has been cited by a number of researchers as one of the most important for the field of AIED. In this paper, we discuss existing progress towards resolving this challenge, break down five sub-challenges, and propose how to address the sub-challenges. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AIED system integration;  BLAP;  Student model sharingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusTong, H., Li, C., Zhang, H.57453908500;57454058000;57276020200;A Fitness Education and Scoring System Based on 3D Human Body Reconstruction(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 13089 LNCS, pp. 242-253.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124662552&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-92836-0_21&partnerID=40&md5=a0adb69000c1ed29456ae248abf0a3b3DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-92836-0_21ABSTRACT: Affected by the Covid-19 epidemic, online fitness education has attracted a large number of users. However, when there are a large number of students in a same online classroom, it is difficult to get the coach’s advice and scores in time. To overcome this problem, we propose an AI fitness education system that uses 3D reconstruction technology to restore the shape of the human body and its bones. The skeleton is used for posture scoring. The 3D human body model is reconstructed by our improved VIBE network, with the accurate posture, shape and movement of the coach and students. By adding the loss function of the end limbs to the 3D human body model, compared with the performance of the original VIBE, we reduce the jitter noise in continuous motion. The training results show the accuracy of our improved VIBE. In addition, we have also established a scoring system, which can score the posture of the trainees based on the coach’s posture, and provide feedback through visual tag points. The experimental results show that our method is feasible and worthy of further exploration. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: 3D human body reconstruction;  Fitness education scoring system;  Improved-VIBEDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusShulzhenko, V.I., Vitkovskaya, L.V., Golovchenko, I.F., Savchenko, T.D., Sumskaya, M.Y.57495980100;57202507150;57202505242;57202495645;57224896230;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS A SPACE OF SPEECH REFLECTION(2021) Advances in Research on Russian Business and Management, 2021, pp. 99-106.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124425962&partnerID=40&md5=27c0be0daa153a24be0a77f137fa6e93ABSTRACT: The chapter deals with the theoretical and practical basis of the functioning of artificial intelligence (AI) as a communicative substance. For this purpose, a major revision was made of the existing ideas about the nature and principles of neorhetoric, which are largely relevant to the goals of the described phenomenon. The relevance of the use in the modern methodology of the well-known scheme of the communicative act of R. O. Jacobson, which confirmed its status as an effective research algorithm in the context of the topic under consideration, is proved. For the first time the theory of dialogue and M. M. Bakhtin’s theory of speech genres are connected with its description, forming the linguo cognitive basis for the creation of optimal communication systems. Moreover, the orientation to the anthropological paradigm of communication remains dominant for the authors, taking into account the specifics of the mentality of the dialogue participants, the mechanisms of speech generation, the language preferences of speakers, and so on. The promising ways of inclusion of AI parameters in general education programs for training specialists at universities are proposed.

In this paper we present a prototype of a DSA for students in higher education of three German universities. The digital data driven DSA is integrated into the local learning management system and consists of recommender modules with a certain kind of recommendation for a specific purpose, e.g., recommending Academic Contacts that fit an expressed academic interest. The modules implemented so far use a wide range of methods: Classic rule-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Neural Networks, that can detect complex features and patterns in large data sets. To evaluate the current prototype of the DSA we used a mixed methods design approach with concurrently collected user data and qualitative data. A first insight in the user data suggests that recommender modules providing personalized recommendations are more likely to be used by students. A focus group discussion with students confirmed these findings with the suggestion to make the DSA more personal, individual, interactive, supportive, and user-friendly. In conclusion we present ideas for the further development of the prototype based on these findings. © 2021 Virtual Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2021.

Any attempt to overcome these shortcomings should be considered worthwhile due to the magnitude of potential impact. Improving the quality and addressing the shortcomings of online education is more important than ever. The goal of this multidisciplinary study that lies in the intersection of the fields of Education Science and Computer Science is to address a number of challenges of online education by incorporating AI. This study focuses on developing methods and means to ethically collect and use non-verbal cues of participants of online classrooms to assist teachers, students, and course coordinators by providing real-time and after-the-fact feedback of the students’ learning-centered affective states. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

However, language generation models' democratization also makes it easier to generate human-like text at-scale for nefarious activities, from spreading misinformation to targeting specific groups with hate speech. Thus, it is essential to understand how people interact with bots and develop methods to detect bot-generated text. This paper shows that bot-generated text detection methods are more robust across datasets and models if we use information about how people respond to it rather than using the bot's text directly. We also analyze linguistic alignment, providing insight into differences between human-human and human-bot conversations. © 2021 Association for Computational LinguisticsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusNg, D.T.K., Leung, J.K.L., Chu, S.K.W., Qiao, M.S.57222469979;57207991196;9943688000;57437507900;Conceptualizing AI literacy: An exploratory review(2021) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 2, art. no. 100041, .

On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “AI literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 30 existing peer-reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e., know and understand, use and apply, evaluate and create, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy. © 2021 The AuthorsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI ethics;  AI in education;  AI learning and teaching;  AI literacy;  AI literacy questionnaireDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusGonzalez, B., Ivagnes, I., Lejtreger, J., Chiruzzo, L., Rosa, A.56276329600;57437139600;57437711100;57028436900;55096646600;Application of Language Technologies to Assist English Teaching(2021) Proceedings - International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society, SCCC, 2021-November, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123908456&doi=10.1109%2fSCCC54552.2021.9650395&partnerID=40&md5=95692fb694c7dc0f339203f0a7fa7393DOI: 10.1109/SCCC54552.2021.9650395ABSTRACT: This work explores the use of standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for the development of teaching support tools.We use these methods for developing an application that allows to automatically create different types of English exercises aimed at students at the beginners level. The web application contains two interfaces, where teachers can generate four types of exercises starting from English texts, and students can solve them. The four types of exercises are: verb form exercises, noun definition exercises, use of English exercises, and lexical relations exercises. Some of the NLP techniques and tools explored during development include: POS-tagging, language models, word embeddings, Levenshtein distance and WordNet. Developing this tool allowed us to test the potential of Natural Language Processing techniques to generate teaching activities. As a way of validating the tool, we tested it with local teachers and found that there is an important demand for these type of tools in our country. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in Education;  English Learning;  Language Models;  NLP;  Word EmbeddingsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusWang, T., Cheng, E.C.K.55535720400;37123500500;An investigation of barriers to Hong Kong K-12 schools incorporating Artificial Intelligence in education(2021) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 2, art. no. 100031, .

In Hong Kong, an increasing number of K-12 schools are planning or piloting their grassroots AIED incorporation practices. However, progress is reportedly slow due to a number of barriers. Unfortunately, because of their limited scope, disputed interpretations and contextual irrelevance, current research literature seems to be of limited referencing value in aiding schools to address the issues and overcome the barriers. This paper highlights the necessity of embracing AIED as wide-ranging given the current understanding of it as a collective notion. Three major directions of AIED are identified: Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI. A collective case study, which examined the perceived barriers to AIED incorporation in Hong Kong K-12 schools with different AIED directions, was conducted. Qualitative data were gathered via ten semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from two schools. Ertmer's (1999) typology was applied to segregate the barriers. The findings showed that both first-order and second-order barriers existed, although they varied between the cases. It was also found that the barriers did not hinder in isolation but appeared to be interconnected. The findings suggest that schools use differentiated strategies to tackle barriers according to their approach to incorporating AIED. Moreover, there is a need to trace the links between barriers and prioritise school efforts to remove or reduce them with high linkage. Several recommendations for practice are given. © 2021 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in Education;  Barrier to change;  K-12 educationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusWang, S., Beheshti, A., Wang, Y., Lu, J., Sheng, Q.Z., Elbourn, S., Alinejad-Rokny, H., Galanis, E.57210801537;57218716096;57208656709;57196194378;57208669610;57539834100;53871090400;57539834200;Assessment2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Assessments to Reduce Marking Workload(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12749 LNAI, pp. 384-389.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123429734&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78270-2_68&partnerID=40&md5=38b462fe0281cf5a168f7a53f9fa1160DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_68ABSTRACT: Reducing instructors workload in online and large-scale learning environments could be one of the most important factors in educational systems.

In this paper, we will introduce the mechanism and effect of group activities supported by “AI teacher” which is a part of the system in PBL education. From 2020, because of COVID-19, we had to do online PBL education with the online communication tools like Zoom. The problem at this time was that when the students were divided into multiple groups and did group work in breakout rooms of Zoom, the teacher could not grasp the situation of the students. Teachers can check by entering the breakout room of each group in turn, but they cannot see the whole students at once. This was a big difference from face-to-face education. Therefore, we introduced the system which possible to check the student's remarks by utilizing the system that automatically records the conversation in the breakout rooms. This allowed teachers to see the progress of each group. Teachers took the initiative and could advice students who did not participate in the activity well. In this paper, we will explain the system configuration that automatically documents the conversation, and explain effect of utilization of the system and problems. In addition, we will explain the overall configuration and mechanism of the “AI teacher”. “AI teacher” use Slack to manage the progress of group activities and provide advice. “AI teacher” is the system that records the conversation as a document, automatically participates in group conversations and gives advice. Also, students can check that they wondered with the AI chatbot. © 2021 Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?.

At the same time, due to the increasing prevalence of AI technology in humans' everyday lives, artificial intelligence (AI) education for K-12 is gaining special attention among CS educators. AI literacy, even more than general CS competencies, requires evidence-based research to be effectively integrated in our schools. The common learning environments utilized for CS education enable us to go beyond conventional educational research approaches by providing a platform where detailed data can be collected from students' interaction with CS-education-related activities. Thus, conventional educational research approaches coupled with insights gained from pattern recognition and student modeling approaches enable us to effectively improve our instruction and to provide students with adaptive scaffolding. In this work, we present our first AI curriculum module that is designed to teach a fundamental AI search algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), through a series of progressively scaffolded activities. Data is collected from a preliminary pilot of this activity with a high-school student in the form of a think-aloud protocol, screen capture, submitted block-based programming artifacts, and interview questions. Our results demonstrate that our activities have been successful in increasing the student's knowledge about the BFS algorithm and more importantly, how this particular AI algorithm can be utilized to solve real world problems. Based on the results of this pilot study, we propose designing a comprehensive AI curriculum contextualized within a learning environment that collects detailed data from students' progress to inform instructional design and facilitate adaptive scaffolding for students. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

As an emerging science and technology, VR/AR technology plays a critical role in society's development and progress, and its application in current education and teaching has become an indispensable link. The production of high-quality animation professionals is the society's and the animation industry's urgent need for talent, the precondition for the prosperity of cultural and creative industries, and the foundation of national soft power. To bring more technical changes to education and provide theoretical support for the realization of human-computer interaction technology, this paper mainly elaborates on the concept and application fields of VR/AR technology and discusses the specific applications of VR/AR technology according to its different educational stages. The main point of the presentation is to demonstrate how, in the era of 5G networks, large bandwidth, ultralow latency, massive connectivity, and ultrahigh reliability provide a strong network foundation for widespread VR/AR application. We will investigate the paucity of teaching methods, teaching modes, and teaching platforms as a result of the application of 5G-based VR/AR technology in the teaching field of animation majors, as well as the design of teaching methods, teaching modes, and experimental training platforms based on 5G-based VR/AR technology in animation majors in conjunction with the training plan of engineering students at our university. We will delve deeper into the integration of VR/AR technology and higher education teaching, laying the groundwork for "AI+"education. VR/AR technology can be used in the classroom to present information to students in a more three-dimensional and intuitive way, which not only increases student interest in learning but also improves the learning experience and cultivates core literacy. © 2021 Lixin Fu.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusGupta, P., Yadav, D., Dey, R.57404267300;57403402100;57403059500;AI Diagnosis: Rise of AI-Powered Assessments in Modern Education Systems(2021) Transnational Marketing Journal, 9 (3), pp. 625-633.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122444241&doi=10.33182%2ftmj.v9i3.1323&partnerID=40&md5=17a4ab20541bd8bb8aa0493671c5575fDOI: 10.33182/tmj.v9i3.1323ABSTRACT: The literature on the limitations on the current archaic education system is limitless, the consequences of which have only been exacerbated in the current lockdown scenario. The timed evaluations have not only failed as an assessment tool during these times but research has shown there are increased rates of using unfair means and proctoring as a result. Not only was the system faulty to begin with, it is failing miserably under current lockdown situations. Simultaneously the current literature keeps positing that since technology has become an integral part of our life already, it would not be long before technology integrates with education and assessments. Taking into consideration the need and potential of an integrative system, this paper aims to explore how artificial intelligence can be effectively introduced into education and improve learning outcomes. The paper performs a Comprehensive Literature Review (CLR), and analyses data based on the framework developed by Onwuegbuzie and Frels (2015). The paper thus reviews literature with the aim to explore current models of AIEd and relevant psychological concepts relating to learning and career outcomes. The evidence is consistence with the rationale for research problem: current AI methodologies in education focus only on delivering learning material, using AI as a means, instead of taking into other factors improving learning and education outcomes. The subsequent literature review on the factors influencing learning outcomes establish that there are two main thematic influences on students learning and behavioral outcomes: inside-school and out of school factors, which have been further implored in context of technological advancements. © 2021.

The quality of teachers' performance mainly influences the quality of educational services in universities. One of the major challenges of higher education institutions is the increase of data and how to utilize them to enhance the academic program's quality and administrative decisions. Hence, in this paper, Artificial Intelligence assisted Multi-Objective Decision-Making model (AI-MODM) has been proposed to predict the instructor's performance in the higher education systems. The proposed AI-assisted prediction model analyzes the numerical values on various elements allocated for a cluster of teachers to evaluate an overall quality evaluation representing the individual instructor's performance level. Instead of replacing teachers, AI technologies would increase and motivate them. These technologies would reduce the time necessary for routine tasks to enable the faculty to focus on teaching and analysis. The usage for administrative decision-making of artificial intelligence and associated digital tools. The experimental results show that the suggested AI-MODM method enhances the accuracy (93.4%), instructor performance analysis (96.7%), specificity analysis (92.5%), RMSE (28.1 %), and precision ratio (97.9%) compared to other existing methods. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  higher education system;  instructor performance;  prediction modelDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusMertanen, K., Vainio, S., Brunila, K.57160087100;57387332400;18036824300;Educating for the future?

In its current mode, education seems unable to answer the needs and interests of the market and future megatrends, such as globalisation and digitalisation. Calls for precision education to introduce the usage of digital platforms, artificial intelligence in education, and knowledge from the behavioural and life sciences are getting a foothold in widening powerful networks of strengthening global governance and EdTech business. By bringing together some of the emerging changes in education governance, in this article we argue for a new constitution of governance, precision education governance. Precision education governance combines three overlapping and strengthening lines of governance: (i) global governance of education, (ii) marketisation, privatisation and digitalisation, and (iii) behavioural and life sciences as the basis for managing the future education. In the article, we highlight the importance in bringing these so far separately studied lines together to understand how they shape the aims and outcomes of education, knowledge and understanding of human subjectivity more thoroughly than before. © The Author(s) 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: behavioural and life sciences;  datafication;  digitalisation;  marketisation;  Precision education governance;  privatisationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusRodríguez-Hernández, C.F., Musso, M., Kyndt, E., Cascallar, E.57213198156;36610520700;26654784300;15130540600;Artificial neural networks in academic performance prediction: Systematic implementation and predictor evaluation(2021) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 2, art. no. 100018, .

However, further conceptual and methodological understanding is needed to advance the systematic implementation of these approaches. The first objective of this study is to test a systematic procedure for implementing artificial neural networks to predict academic performance in higher education. The second objective is to analyze the importance of several well-known predictors of academic performance in higher education. The sample included 162,030 students of both genders from private and public universities in Colombia. The findings suggest that it is possible to systematically implement artificial neural networks to classify students’ academic performance as either high (accuracy of 82%) or low (accuracy of 71%). Artificial neural networks outperform other machine-learning algorithms in evaluation metrics such as the recall and the F1 score. Furthermore, it is found that prior academic achievement, socioeconomic conditions, and high school characteristics are important predictors of students’ academic performance in higher education. Finally, this study discusses recommendations for implementing artificial neural networks and several considerations for the analysis of academic performance in higher education. © 2021 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Academic performance;  Artificial neural networks;  Higher education;  PredictionDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusIto, T., Tanaka, M.S., Shin, M., Miyazaki, K.57189307517;57191908735;57189304179;57189309776;THE ONLINE PBL (PROJECT-BASED LEARNING) EDUCATION SYSTEM USING AI (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE)(2021) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2021, .

Kanazawa Institute of Technology (KIT) applies PBL to its design and engineering programme as Project Design (PD) Programme. Students form small groups to discuss real-life problems and sometimes collaborate with local communities. However, in order to prevent COVID-19 infection, students cannot go to school. Instead, e-Syllabus and the web meeting Zoom (videoconferencing software) are used to take lectures at home. Adding to the PBL class implementation experience under the impact of COVID-19 and to the review results of the progress of digital technology, the outline, and the feature of the on-line PBL education system using chatbot and AI is proposed. Although the system is still under development, some of the components are introduced. © PDE 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence (AI);  Chatbot;  COVID-19;  E-learning;  Online;  PBI;  Text miningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusNazaretsky, T., Cukurova, M., Ariely, M., Alexandron, G.57217055247;56904209900;57207861631;8945106100;Confirmation bias and trust: Human factors that influence teachers' attitudes towards AI-based educational technology(2021) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3042, .

As AI-based educational technology is increasingly entering K-12 education, it is expected that issues of trust would influence the acceptance of such technology by educators as well, but little is known about this matter. In this work, we bring the opinions and attitudes of science teachers that interacted with several types of AI-based technology for K-12. Among other things, our findings indicate that teachers are reluctant to accept AI-based recommendations when it contradicts their previous knowledge about their students, and that they expect AI to be absolutely correct even in situations that absolute truth may not exist (e.g., grading open-ended questions). The purpose of this paper is to provide initial findings and start mapping the terrain of this aspect of teacher-AI interaction, which is critical for the wide and effective deployment of AIED technologies in K-12 education. © 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Blended learning;  Teachers;  TrustDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLau, V.I., Binnie, A., Basmaji, J., Baig, N., Opgenorth, D., Cameron, S., O’Hearn, K., McDonald, E., Senaratne, J., Sligl, W., Zuege, D.J., Rewa, O., Bagshaw, S.M., Tsang, J.57200425917;7004219471;54384973800;56039739900;37016491400;56640724600;57202461335;7101874104;55283486100;6507515397;6505850812;37011534600;7003777149;57210226997;Needs Assessment Survey Identifying Research Processes Which may be Improved by Automation or Artificial Intelligence: ICU Community Modeling and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Efficiency (ICU-Comma)(2021) Journal of Intensive Care Medicine, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121318252&doi=10.1177%2f08850666211064844&partnerID=40&md5=aaae1e95761ead7f683c01de29b1c193DOI: 10.1177/08850666211064844ABSTRACT: Background: Critical care research in Canada is conducted primarily in academically-affiliated intensive care units with established research infrastructure, including research coordinators (RCs). Recently, efforts have been made to engage community hospital ICUs in research albeit with barriers. Automation or artificial intelligence (AI) could aid the performance of routine research tasks. It is unclear which research study processes might be improved through AI automation. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Canadian ICU research personnel. The survey contained items characterizing opinions regarding research processes that may be amenable to AI automation. We distributed the questionnaire via email distribution lists of 3 Canadian research societies. Open-ended questions were analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach. Results: A total of 49 survey responses were received (response rate: 8%). Tasks that respondents felt were time-consuming/tedious/tiresome included: screening for potentially eligible patients (74%), inputting data into case report forms (65%), and preparing internal tracking logs (53%). Tasks that respondents felt could be performed by AI automation included: screening for eligible patients (59%), inputting data into case report forms (55%), preparing internal tracking logs (51%), and randomizing patients into studies (45%). Open-ended questions identified enthusiasm for AI automation to improve information accuracy and efficiency while freeing up RCs to perform tasks that require human interaction. This enthusiasm was tempered by the need for proper AI education and oversight. Conclusions: There were balanced supportive (increased efficiency and re-allocation of tasks) and challenges (informational accuracy and oversight) with regards to AI automation in ICU research. © The Author(s) 2021.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  automation;  critical care;  efficiency;  needs assessment;  research;  surveyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusZembylas, M.6603116020;A decolonial approach to AI in higher education teaching and learning: strategies for undoing the ethics of digital neocolonialism(2021) Learning, Media and Technology, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120815891&doi=10.1080%2f17439884.2021.2010094&partnerID=40&md5=1b1c0c42a874d9bb68a2b4e7f4b7cc9fDOI: 10.1080/17439884.2021.2010094ABSTRACT: The aim of this article is to use decolonial thinking, as applied in the field of AI, to explore the ethical and pedagogical implications for higher education teaching and learning. The questions driving this article are: What does a decolonial approach to AI imply for higher education teaching and learning? How can educators, researchers and students interrogate the coloniality of AI in higher education? Which strategies can be useful for undoing the ethics of digital neocolonialism in higher education? While there is work on decolonial theory in AI as well as literature on the decolonization of higher education, there is not much theorization that brings those literatures together to develop a decolonial conceptual framework for ethical AI in higher education teaching and learning. This article offers this conceptual framing and suggests decolonial strategies that challenge algorithmic coloniality and colonial AI ethics in the context of higher education teaching and learning. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: algorithmic coloniality;  artificial intelligence;  Decolonial theory;  ethics;  higher educationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusZammit, M., Voulgari, I., Liapis, A., Yannakakis, G.57226000737;24825483100;53264261900;14036725000;The road to ai literacy education: From pedagogical needs to tangible game design(2021) Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning, 2021-September, pp. 765-773.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120686002&doi=10.34190%2fGBL.21.155&partnerID=40&md5=b9b777a824d7d069b6dab3b32015c8dbDOI: 10.34190/GBL.21.155ABSTRACT: The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased use in everyday life have exacerbated the need to understand its underlying processes, and to raise awareness about its shortcomings and faults. Consequently there has been an increased effort to teach basic concepts of AI and machine learning (ML) from an early age. Digital games have been shown to be effective as teaching and learning tools, and there are ongoing efforts to increase AI literacy through educational digital games. To this effect, this work describes the process followed to extrapolate the design of such an educational game directly from the pedagogical needs emerging from stakeholders. Seven focus groups and workshops were conducted in Greece, Malta and Norway, with 55 teachers, researchers, practitioners and policy-makers, and 22 primary and secondary education students in total. These workshops identified seven goals which informed the design of a game for AI literacy called ArtBot. The game design process and the final interface and gameplay loop of ArtBot are explained in relation to these goals. The game was subsequently deployed across a variety of platforms, to enable dissemination to a broad audience in classrooms and elsewhere. The game was part of the tools developed in the framework of the LearnML Erasmus+ project. A preliminary online survey was used to gauge how well the game was received by teachers and students, with an overall positive result. A longer-term data collection of the game usage statistics has been initiated and will be analysed over the course of the game dissemination. © The Authors, 2021.

This paper uses a fuzzy clustering algorithm (FCA), designs the sensor network-related equipment, and uses AI to design an electronic music creation system. The analysis of simulation experiments suggests that under the premise of increasing the number of neighbors, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of collaborative filtering and fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms show a downward trend. However, with the same number of neighbors, the filtering matching algorithm is greater than FCA regarding the mean values of MAE and MSE. Meanwhile, on the electronic music performance system of AI, the digital module is designed and the sound data are imaged on the oscilloscope, and the collaboration of electronic music online education and wireless network is completed. The following conclusion is drawn: modularizing the creative mode of intelligent electronic music has achieved higher computational efficiency. Through the oscilloscope, the sound feature is converted into the image structure, and the corresponding sound and image mode is formed, which realizes the purpose of online electronic music intelligent matching and optimizes the effect of online education. In the AI environment, the matching degree of verification electronic music curriculum resources is better than traditional matching algorithms, and the accuracy is higher. © 2021 Ning Xu and Yuanyuan Zhao.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusQurashi, A.A., Alanazi, R.K., Alhazmi, Y.M., Almohammadi, A.S., Alsharif, W.M., Alshamrani, K.M.57159855800;57353418600;57503313800;57353192100;57192654902;57212031558;Saudi radiology personnel’s perceptions of artificial intelligence implementation: A cross-sectional study(2021) Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare, 14, pp. 3225-3231.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119931724&doi=10.2147%2fJMDH.S340786&partnerID=40&md5=a13a1f385b6bac406414fd54a3e88bcdDOI: 10.2147/JMDH.S340786ABSTRACT: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has been a subject of heated debate. The external perception is that algorithms and machines cannot offer better diagnosis than radiolo-gists. Reluctance to implement AI maybe due to the opacity in how AI applications work and the challenging and lengthy validation process. In this study, Saudi radiology personnel’s familiarity with AI applications and its usefulness in clinical practice were investigated. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia among radiology personnel from March to April 2021. Radiology personnel nationwide were surveyed electronically using Google form. The questionnaire included 12-questions related to AI usefulness in clinical practice and participants’ knowledge about AI and their acceptance level to learn and implement this technology into clinical practice. Participants’ trust level was also measured; Kruskal–Wallis test was used to examine differences between groups. Results: A total of 224 respondents from various radiology-related occupations participated in the survey. The lowest trust level in AI applications was shown by radiologists (p = 0.033). Eighty-two percent of participants (n = 184) had never used AI in their departments. Most respondents (n = 160, 71.4%) reported lack of formal education regarding AI-based applications. Most participants (n = 214, 95.5%) showed strong interest in AI education and are willing to incorporate it into the clinical practice of radiology. Almost half of radiography students (22/46, 47.8%) believe that their job might be at risk due to AI application (p = 0.038). Conclusion: Radiology personnel’s knowledge of AI has a significant impact on their willingness to learn, use and adapt this technology in clinical practice. Participants demon-strated a positive attitude towards AI, showed a reasonable understanding and are highly motivated to learn and incorporate it into clinical practice. Some participants felt that their jobs were threatened by AI adaptation, but this belief might change with good training and education programmes. © 2021 Qurashi et al.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI-based applications;  Artificial intelligence;  Imaging modalities;  Radiologists;  RadiologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusZhou, Q., Suraworachet, W., Pozdniakov, S., Martinez-Maldonado, R., Bartindale, T., Chen, P., Richardson, D., Cukurova, M.57215928137;55437649900;57192102175;55255183300;34879569200;57258527700;57193575373;56904209900;Investigating Students’ Experiences with Collaboration Analytics for Remote Group Meetings(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12748 LNAI, pp. 472-485.

This has motivated the use of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) solutions to support the teaching and learning practice in these settings. However, the use of such solutions requires new research particularly with regards to the human factors that ultimately shape the future design and implementations. In this paper, we build on the emerging literature on human-centred AIED and explore students’ experiences after interacting with a tool that monitors their collaboration in remote meetings (i.e., using Zoom) during 10 weeks. Using the social translucence framework, we probed into the feedback provided by twenty students regarding the design and implementation requirements of the system after their exposure to the tool in their course. The results revealed valuable insights in terms of visibility (what should be made visible to students via the system), awareness (how can this information increase students’ understanding of collaboration performance), and accountability (to what extent students take responsibility of changing their behaviours based on the system’s feedback); as well as the ethical and privacy aspects related to the use of collaboration analytics tools in remote meetings. This study provides key suggestions for the future design and implementations of AIED systems for remote meetings in educational settings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Collaboration analytics;  Ethics;  Human-centred AI;  Remote meetingsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusBaker, R.S., Hawn, A.8967971100;57078921700;Algorithmic Bias in Education(2021) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, .

While other recent work has reviewed mathematical definitions of fairness and expanded algorithmic approaches to reducing bias, our review focuses instead on solidifying the current understanding of the concrete impacts of algorithmic bias in education—which groups are known to be impacted and which stages and agents in the development and deployment of educational algorithms are implicated. We discuss theoretical and formal perspectives on algorithmic bias, connect those perspectives to the machine learning pipeline, and review metrics for assessing bias. Next, we review the evidence around algorithmic bias in education, beginning with the most heavily-studied categories of race/ethnicity, gender, and nationality, and moving to the available evidence of bias for less-studied categories, such as socioeconomic status, disability, and military-connected status. Acknowledging the gaps in what has been studied, we propose a framework for moving from unknown bias to known bias and from fairness to equity. We discuss obstacles to addressing these challenges and propose four areas of effort for mitigating and resolving the problems of algorithmic bias in AIED systems and other educational technology. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Algorithmic bias;  Algorithmic fairness;  Artificial intelligence and education;  Machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusHamal, O., Faddouli, N.-E.E., Harouni, M.H.A.57207732368;54784300600;57330971200;Design and implementation of the multi-agent system in education(2021) World Journal on Educational Technology: Current Issues, 13 (4), pp. 775-793.

This issue has been a focus of humanity for millennia, and very significant advances have been made in this quest. This article aims to address the issue of optimizing and improving learning and teaching processes through AI (Artificial Intelligence), considering crossroads of research fields AIED (Artificial Intelligence in Education), EDM (Educational Data Mining) and LA (Learning Analytic). The research made use of secondary data collected from previous research on the topic and primary data was collected using a case study. A comparative analysis was conducted and based on this opportunity, we propose a multi-agent system based on AI techniques, which is capable of performing broader analyses of learning and teaching processes. The research also implemented a prototype of EMAS. Through this system, teachers and learners will be able to access a wide range of relevant and reliable information about learning and teaching processes. © 2021 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

Unlike Chap. 3, which details a whole-school approach, we have specifically focused our attention on developing a curriculum with an associated implementation plan since the ability of teachers to build transferable leadership skills in younger generations are integral to any larger reform initiative. Ultimately, the efficacy of the curriculum is enhanced by a more holistic approach to the prioritization of climate change action in the context of schools and broader education systems, so a synthesis of approaches is recommended. The Climate Change Leadership Curriculum was designed in collaboration with the Arava Institute (AI), an organization in Israel that brings together Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians and international students from outside the region to engage in environmental and peace-building education. The work of AI is specific to tertiary education, so our initiative to build a climate change leadership curriculum constitutes an attempt to expand the reach of the mission and pedagogy of AI to encompass secondary education. The implementation plan also involves leveraging the network of AI to find partners for implementing the curriculum. The fact that there are AI alumni who work in secondary education opened possibilities for dissemination of the curriculum in collaboration with teachers who have a deep understanding of the pedagogy. As teachers integrate the curriculum into their particular contexts, our plan was to not only support them in the implementation, but to also solicit feedback to continually improve the resources and identify the most effective ways to provide support. This will enable us to make the curriculum accessible to teachers from diverse backgrounds in a wide variety of contexts, inside and outside of the target region. © 2021, The Author(s).DOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusBorges Monteiro, A.C., Padilha França, R., Arthur, R., Iano, Y.57321935100;57322407200;57191961791;6507737860;A Look at Artificial Intelligence on the Perspective of Application in the Modern Education(2021) Studies in Computational Intelligence, 953, pp. 171-189.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118463537&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-73819-8_10&partnerID=40&md5=867f881bd7c0d6aef20b8ede5f8b478dDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-73819-8_10ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the objective to produce devices that reproduce human capacity in the spheres of reasoning, awareness, guidance, decision making, and collaboration in problem-solving. Its operation is based on a stimulus from the outside world centered on data analysis; it is usually related to Machine Learning. AI in Education also expands the teachers’ capabilities, allowing them to focus on his most important task, i.e., accompanying students individually and supporting the teaching–learning process more effectively. In this sense, the greater the volume of interactions in the digital environment, the greater the system’s ability to update its information based on student interactions. Through the performance analysis of students and classes, it is possible to articulate new approaches and educational actions through the data collected concerning learning. Since the student, when engaged, learns very well with technology, and so, the system can, for example, know in which areas a student does best, how they reason to solve problems and what they seek to complement his learning. However, AI makes it possible for the teacher to make more assertive decisions in supporting student learning, it is still worth considering that technology does not replace the teacher, but helps them to perfect and optimize his classes. Therefore, this chapter aims to provide an updated overview of AI in Education, showing its context on the horizon in teaching, addressing and approaching its branch of application potential, with a concise bibliographic background, synthesizing the potential of technology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Education;  Learning;  Machine learning;  TechnologiesDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYe, R., Sun, F., Li, J.57279176500;57279616000;57209298595;Artificial Intelligence in Education: Origin, Development and Rise(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 13016 LNAI, pp. 545-553.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118166622&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-89092-6_49&partnerID=40&md5=79e56ba813d27bb9a84f84bd83ce0f78DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-89092-6_49ABSTRACT: In recent years, artificial intelligence in education has grown in popularity.

Student readiness and capability regarding self-regulated learning (SRL), the activity logs in the learning management system, and academic achievement were collected to investigate behavioral sequences of different typologies of learning self-regulation. Seventeen students who took OCI in the 2019 school year were recruited for the study. Through learning analytics for the 3965 behavioral codes, the study generated three key results. First, hierarchical cluster analysis classified two typologies of self-regulated online learners: High self-regulated learners (H-SRLs) and low self-regulated learners (L-SRLs). Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test further revealed a higher academic achievement in H-SRLs than that of the L-SRLs. Second, lag sequential analysis portrayed different behavioral sequences in the performance control phrase of SRL. H-SRLs tended to leverage proper learning skills like practice immediately after receiving assistance whereas L-SRLs exit immediately without taking further actions after learning new materials, revisited the syllabus, and checked course grades. Qualitative interviews further confirmed the relationship between different strategies used in the phase and the academic performance. L-SRLs were more likely to adopt passive learning strategies and even mismatched goals and strategies during online learning, while H-SRLs appeared otherwise. To support successful online learning experiences, the researchers suggest integrating workshops and resources into the online learning orientation that focus on the performance control of SRL. Moreover, AIED platform features also may support L-SRLs in performing proper learning strategies. © 2021 The AuthorsAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Cluster analysis;  Learning analytics;  Online learning;  Self-regulated learning;  Sequential analysisDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusLai, C.-L.56447570500;Exploring University Students’ Preferences for AI-Assisted Learning Environment: A Drawing Analysis with Activity Theory Framework(2021) Educational Technology and Society, 24 (4), pp. 1-15.

A total of 64 teacher education students from a university in Taiwan participated in the study. The participants were asked to describe their perceptions of AI-assisted learning in the form of drawings and text descriptions. In order to analyze the content of the students’ drawings, a coding scheme was developed based on the activity theory framework. Based on the results of the analysis, it was found that students placed more importance on personalized guidance and appropriate learning content provision. In addition, students acknowledged that AI technology can be used flexibly in different fields and situations. Interestingly, more than half of the students agreed that robots play important roles in AI-assisted learning. This indicates that the students expected a social AI learning companion. However, it was found that students’ expectations of an AI learning environment were less connected to the real environment and did not reveal learning activities with higher order thinking. In addition to the need for accurate and fast AI computing, this result indicated that professional instructional guidance is also an expectation that students have of AI education. © 2021AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Activity theory framework;  AI education;  Co-word analysis;  Drawing analysis;  Preference of learning environmentDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusOuyang, F., Jiao, P.57193380924;55604705500;Artificial intelligence in education: The three paradigms(2021) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 2, art. no. 100020, .

Artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) opens new opportunities, potentials, and challenges in educational practices. In its short history, AIEd has been undergoing several paradigmatic shifts, which are characterized into three paradigms in this position paper: AI-directed, learner-as-recipient, AI-supported, learner-as-collaborator, and AI-empowered, learner-as-leader. In three paradigms, AI techniques are used to address educational and learning issues in varied ways. AI is used to represent knowledge models and direct cognitive learning while learners are recipients of AI service in Paradigm One; AI is used to support learning while learners work as collaborators with AI in Paradigm Two; AI is used to empower learning while learners take agency to learn in Paradigm Three. Overall, the development trend of AIEd has been developing to empower learner agency and personalization, enable learners to reflect on learning and inform AI systems to adapt accordingly, and lead to an iterative development of the learner-centered, data-driven, personalized learning. © 2021 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI-Directed;  AI-Empowered;  AI-Supported;  Artificial intelligence in education;  Learner-as-collaborator;  Learner-as-leader;  Learner-as-recipient;  ParadigmsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusBaker, R.S., Gašević, D., Karumbaiah, S.8967971100;8549413500;57194788279;Four paradigms in learning analytics: Why paradigm convergence matters(2021) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 2, art. no. 100021, .

The field has rapidly grown in terms of the reputation of its publication venues, established a vibrant community, and has demonstrated an increasing impact on policy and practice. However, the boundaries of the field are still being explored by many researchers in a bid to determine what differentiates a contribution in learning analytics from contributions in related fields, which also center around data in education. In this paper, we propose that instead of emphasizing the examination of differences, a healthy development of the field should focus on collaboration and be informed by the developments in related fields. Specifically, the paper presents a framework for analysis how contemporary fields focused on the study of data in education influence trends in learning analytics. The framework is focused on the methodological paradigms that each of the fields is primarily based on – i.e., essentialist, entatitive/reductionst, ontological/dialectical, and existentialist. The paper uses the proposed framework to analyze how learning analytics (ontological) is being methodologically influenced by recent trends in the fields of educational data mining (entatitive), quantitative ethnography (existentialist), and learning at scale (essentialist). Based on the results of the analysis, this paper identifies gaps in the literature that warrant future research. © 2021 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence in education;  Learning analytics;  Learning at scale;  Machine learning;  Quantitative ethnography;  Research paradigmsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusMarras, M., Boratto, L., Ramos, G., Fenu, G.57193883534;35106859100;56354034800;24469552000;Equality of Learning Opportunity via Individual Fairness in Personalized Recommendations(2021) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, .

Therefore, while building overlying content recommendation services, it becomes essential to guarantee that learners are provided with equal recommended learning opportunities, according to the platform principles, context, and pedagogy. Though the importance of ensuring equality of learning opportunities has been well investigated in traditional institutions, how this equality can be operationalized in online learning ecosystems through recommender systems is still under-explored. In this paper, we shape a blueprint of the decisions and processes to be considered in the context of equality of recommended learning opportunities, based on principles that need to be empirically-validated (no evaluation with live learners has been performed). To this end, we first provide a formalization of educational principles that model recommendations’ learning properties, and a novel fairness metric that combines them to monitor the equality of recommended learning opportunities among learners. Then, we envision a scenario wherein an educational platform should be arranged in such a way that the generated recommendations meet each principle to a certain degree for all learners, constrained to their individual preferences. Under this view, we explore the learning opportunities provided by recommender systems in a course platform, uncovering systematic inequalities. To reduce this effect, we propose a novel post-processing approach that balances personalization and equality of recommended opportunities. Experiments show that our approach leads to higher equality, with a negligible loss in personalization. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for future studies of learners’ preferences and limits concerning the equality of recommended learning opportunities. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AIED;  Ethics;  Learning analytics;  Recommender systemsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusSun, X.57288479100;5G Joint Artificial Intelligence Technology in the Innovation and Reform of University English Education(2021) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2021, art. no. 4892064, .

It is also a further examination of the issue of human subjectivity in the new context. On the other hand, it is also a further examination of the issue of human subjectivity in the new context of the times, which can also provide students with an immersive learning environment, and AI artificial intelligence and hologram technology can enhance students' motivation. This paper shows the specific steps and implementation measures of "5G"technology into online oral teaching and provides a case study design to explore the new online oral teaching model, summarizing the advantages and proposing solutions to the shortcomings. The system visualizes each step of gesture recognition to facilitate students' understanding. Students can experience the process of gesture recognition according to the guidance of the interactive interface, and then, the complex and abstract gesture recognition process is explained with a figurative example, which is conducive to primary and secondary school students' deeper understanding and improved logical thinking. This will help primary and secondary school students to have a deeper understanding and improve their logical thinking skills. Finally, a comparison experiment is designed to verify the effectiveness of using this system to learn AI knowledge compared with traditional learning methods. The experimental results are analyzed to prove that using this system to learn AI knowledge is effective and helps improve users' interest in learning and hands-on ability. © 2021 Xia Sun.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusBhimdiwala, A., Neri, R.C., Gomez, L.M.57218097558;57203019246;7202331849;Advancing the Design and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Education through Continuous Improvement(2021) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116271500&doi=10.1007%2fs40593-021-00278-8&partnerID=40&md5=1becc04196e25fa9fe81d3d516b94879DOI: 10.1007/s40593-021-00278-8ABSTRACT: With the rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd), multiple stakeholders are questioning AI’s capability to make fair and trustworthy decisions that improve teaching and learning. We suspect that unfair and unreliable outcomes might stem from lack of systematic collaboration between the developers of AIEd systems and the educators tasked with their implementation. In a profession that is underresourced, teachers don’t merely need technology-centered solutions. Rather they and the students they serve need useful tools that work in culturally and socially complex instructional environments. In this article, the authors argue that FATE in AIEd-related issues must be addressed as the system evolves with users and the local context. This requires supporting the development of users’ ownership over AIEd systems that is needed to adapt them to their local contexts. It is in this process of gaining ownership that significant issues related to the FATE of AIEd systems present themselves. Inspired by continuous improvement approaches, we propose that the pursuit of FATE of AIEd lays broadly in: (a) promoting systematic inquiry and collaboration between educators, developers, and researchers; (b) exploring, through collaborative efforts, how on-the-ground realities influence the implementation of AIEd; and (c) using variation as an opportunity to learn how to make a system work reliably and across contexts. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of continuous improvement for research, development, and practice of AIEd. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Continuous improvement;  Teacher-AI collaboration;  User-centered approachesDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusSun, F., Ye, R.57680390800;57279176500;Moral Considerations of Artificial Intelligence(2021) Science and Education, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116030682&doi=10.1007%2fs11191-021-00282-3&partnerID=40&md5=8af14956b9376592341f98c4a991cea2DOI: 10.1007/s11191-021-00282-3ABSTRACT: One of the ultimate problems of moral philosophy is to determine who or what is worth moral consideration or not. “Morality” is a relative concept, which changes significantly with the environment and time. This means that morality is incredibly inclusive. The emergence of AI technology has a significant impact on the understanding and distribution of “subject,” which has produced a new situation in moral issues. When considering the morality of AI, moral problems must also involve moral agents and moral patients. A more inclusive moral definition is necessary for extending the scope of moral consideration to other traditionally marginalized entities. The evolving ethics redefines the center of moral consideration, effectively reduces the differences, becomes more inclusive, and includes more potential participants. But we may still need to jump out of this binary framework and solve the problem by rewriting rules. It is a huge, complex systematic project to realize moral AI in education. To be a “trustworthy” and “responsible” companion of teachers and students, educational AI must have extensive consistency with teachers and students in terms of the moral theoretical basis and expected value. The deep integration of AI and education is likely to become the development trend of education in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusRébé, N.57224903120;Artificial intelligence robot law, policy and ethics(2021) Nijhoff Law Specials, 102, pp. 1-262.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115927452&partnerID=40&md5=189868906837bd6ae758d0f136662cd8ABSTRACT: Education has for ages dealt with the notion of the master teaching its student about life and disciplinary matters. The type of course we decide to study is only a bonus to this relationship, external to our family life. New technolo­gies can worry old professors in that they could feel that no machine or algo­rithm could ever replace such bond between humans. We have seen with the 2019– 2020 corona virus pandemic the incredible benefits man can reap from online learning. The algorithms tailormade education AI can provide students is unavoidable, but had barely evolved the past decades in relation to what we could really do if we wanted to set up a worldwide AI educational system. Man might have to accept that certain exceptional life situations could require the inclusion of new technologies in our educational systems to avoid children’s isolation and help them enhance their school’s knowledge. Harmonization of school systems must come through international agreements on specific learning standards and methods. Until then, nations should promote the use of AI in education and research. © 2021 Brill Nijhoff.

It aims to provide learners with intuitive environments for autonomous knowledge formation and discovery through interactive experiences. However, experiential learning in AIEd faces two main challenges. Firstly, measuring learning performances in unstructured and informal educational settings is difficult. Secondly, providing frequent or timely feedback on student performance is inefficient. To address these issues, this paper explores using natural language processing (NLP) and the tool for the automatic analysis of cohesion (TAACO) features as indicators of student performance in an experiential learning course. Both NLP and TAACO features were tested on a baseline CART decision tree (DT) machine learning (ML) model with and without a grade population distribution mask to predict student final scores at the end of the course. Our results show that (1), the use of a distribution specific Gaussian mask significantly increases prediction accuracy of the CART DT. (2), NLP and TAACO features provide high information value for ML prediction tasks. (3), the CART DT is able to accurately classify learner grade scores against human assessments. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Data mining;  Decision trees;  Education;  Experiential learning;  Natural language processing;  Scientific method;  StatisticsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusRahm, L.56688435800;Education, automation and AI: a genealogy of alternative futures(2021) Learning, Media and Technology, .

At the same time, skills and competencies are also necessary to drive innovation and technical development for the progressive creation of desirable futures. Jumping back to the 1950s, this article illustrates how automation and AI have been anticipated as both problems and solutions in society, and how education has been used to solve these problems or realize these solutions. That is, computerization debates have concentrated on both the growing opportunities and the increasing risks, but almost always also on the need for corresponding education.

Promoting the technical and modernized construction of the physical education curriculum in colleges and universities is crucial to enhance higher education's science and performance. In this technological era, the Internet of Things (IoT) is used in physical education to train and record physical activities. In this research, the AI-based IoT system (AI-IoTS) Wearable technology is promoted for IoT-based Human–Computer Interaction for College Physical education. This AI-IoTS consist of a Cloud Platform and three layers of AI. The AI-IoTS recognizes the data required for the students. Collect the data from the cloud using an IoT platform and processes it with the help of AI. The student can train themselves using wearable technology without the help of the Physical instructor. The simulation method of the proposed framework "AI-IoTS" proved that it could collect and teach students independently.

These documents articulate plans and expectations regarding how AI will impact policy sectors, including education, and typically discuss the social and ethical implications of AI. This article engages in thematic analysis of 24 such national AI policy strategies, reviewing the role of education in global AI policy discourse. It finds that the use of AI in education (AIED) is largely absent from policy conversations, while the instrumental value of education in supporting an AI-ready workforce and training more AI experts is overwhelmingly prioritized. Further, the ethical implications of AIED receive scant attention despite the prominence of AI ethics discussion generally in these documents. This suggests that AIED and its broader policy and ethical implications—good or bad—have failed to reach mainstream awareness and the agendas of key decision-makers, a concern given that effective policy and careful consideration of ethics are inextricably linked, as this article argues. In light of these findings, the article applies a framework of five AI ethics principles to consider ways in which policymakers can better incorporate AIED’s implications. Finally, the article offers recommendations for AIED scholars on strategies for engagement with the policymaking process, and for performing ethics and policy-oriented AIED research to that end, in order to shape policy deliberations on behalf of the public good. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Ethics;  Policy;  Social implications of technologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusKewalramani, S., Kidman, G., Palaiologou, I.57202621442;16316232500;36089232800;Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-interfaced robotic toys in early childhood settings: a case for children’s inquiry literacy(2021) European Early Childhood Education Research Journal, 29 (5), pp. 652-668.

Arguments about the appropriate role of AI in EC education have received much attention when examining the potential of the integration of technology into children’s play and learning. Using Vygotsky’s mediation theory (1978) and employing a design-based research methodology, teachers intentionally used AI robotic toys to engage children (4–5 years old) during play experiences. The data from both teachers’ and children’s interviews, observations and artefact analysis revealed how children creatively collaborated with their peers to create a sustainable city for their robot and ‘his’ family to live happily. Children’s play with the AI robot fostered inquiry literacies–namely creative inquiry, emotional inquiry and collaborative inquiry. This study contributes to research by exploring the use of AI toys together with physical and artificial environments and offers a case to shape children’s inquiry literacies. Implications lie in upskilling EC teachers to provide opportunities to play with AI-interfaced robotic toys to foster children’s inquiry literacy development process. © 2021 EECERA.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence (AI) toys in early childhood education;  children’s inquiry literacy;  creative inquiry;  emotional literacy;  Robotic toys in early childhoodDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLaksana, E.A.57191849066;The Integration of Artificial Intelligence Education into Various Human Resource Management Functions and Their Impact on Education Industry and Environment(2021) Review of International Geographical Education Online, 11 (3), pp. 137-143.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113370039&doi=10.33403%2frigeo.800477&partnerID=40&md5=7d71661817a6d57de481552b9076f23fDOI: 10.33403/rigeo.800477ABSTRACT: This paper focuses on explaining how artificial intelligence (AI) education has been integrated into different human resource (HR) functions and their impact on education industry, and the environment.

AI plays a vital role in the health sector, like detecting, diagnosing, predicting diseases in advance to reduce the suffering and mortality rate. Besides, application of AI techniques improves hospital management and detection of health insurance fraud. With increased automation in the medical sector, advancements in image acquisition devices and availability of personal wearable devices at affordable cost, voluminous data are being generated. Deep learning techniques can leverage this big data with powerful Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) based systems to analyze and detect hidden patterns in the data and gain insights. Deep learning techniques can learn features from big data sets to get insights that will assist doctors in early diagnosis and treatment. Medical data analysis faces many challenges like limited data availability due to privacy issues, unbalanced data sets for diseases like cancer and rare disease, unavailability of specialists for labeling the data, variation in the experts’ opinion in decision making, variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle of individuals. This chapter discusses the techniques for dealing with the challenges of medical data processing. It also presents the AI techniques for identifying and predicting different types of cancer, diabetes, cardiac, and rare diseases at an early stage using data sets of different formats like clinical data, gene expression data, and medical images. The chapter includes the sections that discuss the methods to deal with unbalanced, small, and high-dimensional data sets, data and label denoising methods, and feature representation learning using neural networks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Data augmentation;  Deep learning;  Feature extraction;  Transfer learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMarzouk, O.A.16417244000;Accrediting Artificial Intelligence Programs from the Omani and the International ABET Perspectives(2021) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 285, pp. 462-474.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112723659&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-80129-8_33&partnerID=40&md5=ae87bb86fd1b3589ed59924d424e99bdDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-80129-8_33ABSTRACT: With an increasing interest in launching artificial intelligence (AI) programs at higher education institutions, both at the undergraduate level and the postgraduate level, a parallel interest in accrediting these programs locally and internationally should arise. This work considers two accreditation systems. One system is local in the Sultanate of Oman, and it is managed by the Oman Academic Accreditation Authority (OAAA), as per its current version (as of September 2020). The other system is recognized internationally, which has accredited programs in more than 30 countries, and it is managed by the U.S.-based non-governmental agency ABET. It is described here as per the 2020–2021 accreditation cycle of ABET, which is the current cycle (as of September 2020). Exploring the applicability of both systems to artificial intelligence programs, the following findings were reached: None of the systems has explicit customization for artificial intelligence specialization. The local Omani accreditation of an AI program comes after a 2-stage institutional accreditation first, with its two stages separated by about 4 years. On the other hand, ABET accreditation combines the institutional and the program assessments in one process. The OAAA program accreditation is available to both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees of artificial intelligence programs. ABET program accreditation applies only to bachelor programs of artificial intelligence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: ABET;  Accreditation;  AI;  Artificial intelligence;  OAAADOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusPapa, R., Jackson, K.M.56919375100;57218250357;Enduring Questions, Innovative Technologies: Educational Theories Interface with AI(2021) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 284, pp. 725-742.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112682555&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-80126-7_51&partnerID=40&md5=d835f192ec473ab8a2a11b970f987093DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-80126-7_51ABSTRACT: This paper aims to tie literature in AI to enduring questions in education about teaching and learning and discern ethical considerations that define those ties. The challenge was to answer the question: how do we merge our learning and leadership theories to technologies and the algorithmic biases that may maintain today's social injustices into our future? The paper first reviews the literature to identify the dialogue on AI by computer scientists in relation to enduring questions in education, learning theories, and ethics. Then we summarize data in the form of vignettes written by experts from the humanities, computer science, and social sciences. Some of the vignettes focused on how educational and technological systems are products of the social system and the ethical implications of such connections. Other writings centered data-driven approaches to incorporating AI technologies in classrooms, with concerns around uneven implementation and differential access. The paper concludes that to dialogue with educators AIED will need to move away from discussions of efficiency as measured by educational assessments and incorporate humanistic and social learning theories that embrace the complexities of human relationships. Developers should seek to work directly with educational leaders to establish optimal teaching strategies for the ethical ‘good’ of the learner, while attending to social justice parameters.

We live in a technological era that represents new possibilities and challenges for society, and for the educational models in each country [1]. Research on smart education, which has forced the educational community to rethink on new ways of learning and teaching has been developed globally. Due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the educational model for both, teachers and students will change. Nevertheless, to transform educational systems, it is necessary to update and train students, educators, and administrators effectively [2]. This research aims to describe the possible applications of AI in education from: 1) the automation of administrative tasks; 2) collection and analysis of information [3] to create smart content; 3) the implementation of virtual assistants in the teaching-learning process; 4) the potential delivery of lectures by humanoid robots with AI. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Big Data;  Humanoid robots;  IoT;  Virtual assistantsDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusAl-Haimi, B., Hujainah, F., Nasir, D., Alhroob, E.57190251204;57189232834;57226666932;57208524932;Higher education institutions with artificial intelligence: roles, promises, and requirements(2021) Studies in Computational Intelligence, 954, pp. 221-238.

Several industries and sectors that adopted AI have benefited from this technological advancement. One such sector is higher education, which can potentially receive the maximum benefits of AI revolution. However, the roles, benefits, and promises of AI in higher education institutions (HEIs) have not been sufficiently investigated and require further research. Therefore, this chapter, which has an extensive literature review, is conducted to reveal how HEIs have benefited from AI and must be met to prepare for such powerful technology. Results reveal that AI has high possibility to reshape HEIs in many ways; for this reason, HEIs must be prepared to benefit from its numerous advantages. Researchers and policymakers can use this study’s findings in HEIs as a solid base for further investigation and crafting strategies. © Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

However, its necessity stares in the face of learners, teachers and all stakeholders in the education space like never before. The purpose of the present research is to throw light on the fact that embedding of AI is a necessity and not a choice. As Edtech becomes the new paradigm, educators need to use AI to achieve the age-old goals of education viz., it should be effective, outcome-based, individualized, transformative, interdisciplinary and life-long. The present research is exploratory in nature and makes an attempt not only to showcase the shift in education practices but also tries to put forth the present trends in embedding AI. The researchers deliberate on the same and try to make a point of how development of education is synchronous with development in AI. The attempt to study the same is contextual and hopes to provide fertile ground for a further deliberation on exploring the potential of AI based online learning tools. The study is conceptual in nature and a harbinger of empirical studies done across regions and segments in the Education space. © Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

However, due to large numbers of learners and their diverse backgrounds, it is taxing to offer real-time support. Learners may post their feelings of confusion and struggle in the respective MOOC forums, but with the large volume of posts and high workloads for MOOC instructors, it is unlikely that the instructors can identify all learners requiring intervention. This problem has been studied as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem recently, and is known to be challenging, due to the imbalance of the data and the complex nature of the task. In this paper, we explore for the first time Bayesian deep learning on learner-based text posts with two methods: Monte Carlo Dropout and Variational Inference, as a new solution to assessing the need of instructor interventions for a learner’s post. We compare models based on our proposed methods with probabilistic modelling to its baseline non-Bayesian models under similar circumstances, for different cases of applying prediction. The results suggest that Bayesian deep learning offers a critical uncertainty measure that is not supplied by traditional neural networks. This adds more explainability, trust and robustness to AI, which is crucial in education-based applications. Additionally, it can achieve similar or better performance compared to non-probabilistic neural networks, as well as grant lower variance. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence in education;  Bayesian modelling;  Deep learning;  Educational data mining;  Natural language processing;  Urgent instructor interventionDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusDiCerbo, K.6603405804;Why Not Go All-In with Artificial Intelligence?(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12792 LNCS, pp. 361-369.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112232805&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-77857-6_25&partnerID=40&md5=263aa10dd7e6ba6f6abbe4289aa7914aDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-77857-6_25ABSTRACT: Despite decades of research and significant current investment, AI-based applications in education have not gotten traction at scale in a way that transforms learning. The most common learning and assessment applications are intelligent tutoring systems that adjust content based on a student profile and automated essay scoring systems that apply “learned” models of scoring to score written assignments. Among the challenges facing these applications in achieving classroom implementation are: trust, existing systems of teacher and student roles and responsibilities, and fairness. This paper discusses these issues and then examines a case study of the use and subsequent removal of artificial intelligence in Khan Academy offerings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Activity theory;  Artificial intelligence;  Fairness;  TrustDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusCasas-Roma, J., Conesa, J., Caballé, S.57197726226;57210953285;57210953378;Education, Ethical Dilemmas and AI: From Ethical Design to Artificial Morality(2021) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12792 LNCS, pp. 167-182.

While considering a case of an ethical dilemma in education presented in [17], it can be seen how, in these situations, it might be needed to take into consideration the student’s needs, preferences, and potentially conflicting goals, as well as their personal and social contexts. Due to this, planning and foreseeing ethically challenging situations in advance, which would be how ethical design is normally used in technological artifacts, is not enough. As AI systems become more autonomous, the amount of possible situations, choices and effects their actions can have grow exponentially. In this paper, we bring together the analysis of ethical dilemmas in education and the need to incorporate moral reasoning into the AI systems’ decision procedures. We argue how ethical design, although necessary, is not sufficient for that task and that artificial morality, or equivalent tools, are needed in order to integrate some sort of “ethical sensor” into autonomous systems taking a deeper role in an educational settings in order to enable them to, if not resolve, at least identify new ethically-relevant scenarios they are faced with. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI Ethics;  Artificial morality;  Ethical sensors;  Online learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHamam, D.57217535898;The New Teacher Assistant: A Review of Chatbots’ Use in Higher Education(2021) Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1421, pp. 59-63.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112047762&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78645-8_8&partnerID=40&md5=a5d3587924b118b98a987d4be9b4f206DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-78645-8_8ABSTRACT: This paper aims at reviewing the use of chatbots in teaching and learning in higher education. Since AI and chatbots represent a rapidly-evolving field, a review of recent academic papers on the topic was needed. Through the systematic review method described by Kitchenham [3], academic papers written between 2018–2020 were reviewed to analyse the benefits and the limitations of using chatbots in the higher education field. The focus was on teaching and learning using chatbots, not on providing general services like customer service or answering students’ general queries. The review findings reveal many benefits of using chatbots in higher education, such as improving teaching and learning, increasing students’ engagement, and providing an individualised experience, especially for large classes. However, some limitations were also identified, such as technical and functionality issues and other privacy and security issues. To sum up, more research is needed to explore the benefits of chatbots in the field of higher education. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Chatbot-higher education;  Teaching with technologyDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYanrong, W.57226437030;Research of the Innovative Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Vocational Education in the New Ecology of Education(2021) Proceedings - 2021 2nd International Conference on Education, Knowledge and Information Management, ICEKIM 2021, art. no. 9479609, pp. 468-473.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111592943&doi=10.1109%2fICEKIM52309.2021.00109&partnerID=40&md5=6d44b7337b303d3a157966ad2067ae6bDOI: 10.1109/ICEKIM52309.2021.00109ABSTRACT: The development of artificial intelligence will certainly fundamentally change the pattern of human work. With the promotion of top-level strategies, vocational education can only develop sustainably by integrating with science and technology. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that studies the basic theories, methods and techniques of how to apply computer hardware and software to simulate certain intelligent human behaviors. Artificial intelligence applied to vocational education mainly focuses on resource network technology and integrated distributed intelligent system, which organically integrates various different expert systems (ES), management information systems (MIS), intelligent networks, decision support systems (DSS), databases, numerical computing packages and graphics processing programs to solve complex problems. Artificial intelligence will certainly empower vocational education and give rise to a vocational education revolution. In the process of continuous improvement of AI, it is a more practical approach to apply various already mature AI technologies to vocational education practice. Establishing an intelligent vocational education ecology enables traditional education and AI to complement each other's advantages and jointly promote the healthy and sustainable development of vocational education ecology. © 2021 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  education ecology;  innovation;  integration;  top-level strategy;  vocational educationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusErmağan, İ.57195569331;Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Studies with a Comparative Perspective: How Ready is Turkey for This Revolution?(2021) Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 239 LNNS, pp. 500-512.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111380211&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-77246-8_46&partnerID=40&md5=cd3516e29559cdac5a013383ed3bc530DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-77246-8_46ABSTRACT: This study focuses on AI in its mission of fundamental dynamics of transformation and the work carried out in this field in the world.

The introduction of such technology to primary and high school students is felt significant to harness the creativity of youths faster and earlier. In order to do so, it is important to give them access to friendly and easy technologies. This eventually will help them realize the potential of IoT and AI. This project studies two platforms Arduino IDE and runlinc IDE on their user-friendliness, ease of IoT STEM AI application development. A system model-based experimental comparison was carried out. The microcontrollers and sensors are independent variables. The required program code in lines of statements, time taken to develop the program code, and parameters controlled by sensors as dependent variables. The user experience survey was conducted to supplement the experimental findings. The respondents are primary and high school students, university students and teachers, professionals, and researchers. Respondents are largely who had experience of using both Arduino and runlinc.

However, many developing countries lack the basic infrastructure needed for taking advantage of AI systems, which could worsen the new technological, economic, and social divides. Ensuring the inclusion and equity of AI in education is one of the challenges that we need to solve. How can we support the urgent needs of developing countries and the underprivileged communities so that the divide between “haves” and “have-nots” will not continue to grow? This is the core question that this project is trying to address. This paper introduces the AI-robotics project focusing on developing an open-source affordable AI-robotics tool to address the need to promote AI literacy around the world. CogBots, the AI-empowered educational learning tool, has been in development collaboratively with Google, CogLabs and UNESCO. The project targets upper elementary and middle school students to promote AI literacy, including the 5 Big Ideas in AI, using the AI-powered educational robotics tool and the Teachable Machine by Google Creative Lab providing a machine learning experience. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI literacy;  AI-robotics;  Artificial intelligenceDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusPammer-Schindler, V., Rosé, C.24767103600;8097137900;Data-Related Ethics Issues in Technologies for Informal Professional Learning(2021) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110903130&doi=10.1007%2fs40593-021-00259-x&partnerID=40&md5=2f7b9e39aa3dec5a45c8f990516bf0a1DOI: 10.1007/s40593-021-00259-xABSTRACT: Professional and lifelong learning are a necessity for workers. This is true both for re-skilling from disappearing jobs, as well as for staying current within a professional domain. AI-enabled scaffolding and just-in-time and situated learning in the workplace offer a new frontier for future impact of AIED. The hallmark of this community’s work has been i) data-driven design of learning technology and ii) machine-learning enabled personalized interventions. In both cases, data are the foundation of AIED research and data-related ethics are thus central to AIED research. In this paper we formulate a vision how AIED research could address data-related ethics issues in informal and situated professional learning. The foundation of our vision is a secondary analysis of five research cases that offer insights related to data-driven adaptive technologies for informal professional learning. We describe the encountered data-related ethics issues. In our interpretation, we have developed three themes: Firstly, in informal and situated professional learning, relevant data about professional learning – to be used as a basis for learning analytics and reflection or as a basis for adaptive systems - is not only about learners. Instead, due to the situatedness of learning, relevant data is also about others (colleagues, customers, clients) and other objects from the learner’s context. Such data may be private, proprietary, or both. Secondly, manual tracking comes with high learner control over data. Thirdly, learning is not necessarily a shared goal in informal professional learning settings. From an ethics perspective, this is particularly problematic as much data that would be relevant for use within learning technologies hasn’t been collected for the purposes of learning. These three themes translate into challenges for AIED research that need to be addressed in order to successfully investigate and develop AIED technology for informal and situated professional learning. As an outlook of this paper, we connect these challenges to ongoing research directions within AIED – natural language processing, socio-technical design, and scenario-based data collection - that might be leveraged and aimed towards addressing data-related ethics challenges. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI-enabled educational technology;  Data-related ethics;  Lifelong learning;  Professional learning;  Workplace learningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid GoldSOURCE: ScopusStriepe, M., Thomson, S., Sefcik, L.55893250200;57219549336;57192923946;Understanding Academic Integrity Education: Case Studies from Two Australian Universities(2021) Journal of Academic Ethics, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110772580&doi=10.1007%2fs10805-021-09429-x&partnerID=40&md5=1f508a431fd7a18f751a6140a0b28bc3DOI: 10.1007/s10805-021-09429-xABSTRACT: An increase in Academic Integrity (AI) breaches has resulted in higher education institutions implementing solutions to improve AI competence. It has been argued that to improve students’ AI understanding, concepts and skills should be taught at the classroom level and contextual factors should be considered. This article presents an investigation on how AI is taught at the classroom level across a range of disciplines, how contextual factors inform approaches to AI education, and how the approaches align with evidence-based recommendations. Purposeful sampling procedures were employed to select units of study from disciplines at two Australian universities. Qualitative data collection methods were used to capture ways AI education was approached and the collected data were analysed through grounded theory methods. The findings show that AI was primarily taught through explicit instruction and personal storytelling and assessed through summative assessment. Such approaches appear to be influenced by personal philosophies, institutional mandates and student backgrounds. While the approaches align with the notion that best practice includes an educative approach, other facets of best practice that have been promoted to combat the rise in AI breaches such as collusion, assessment outsourcing and cheating in exams were not evident. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Academic integrity;  Classroom practice;  Context;  DisciplineDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusChiu, C.-K., Tseng, J.C.R.23388632100;7102232473;A Bayesian Classification Network based Learning Status Management System in an Intelligent Classroom(2021) Educational Technology and Society, 24 (3), pp. 256-267.

Several observation instruments have been designed for human observers to document students’ engagement in class, but the processes are time-consuming and laborious. Recently, with the development of artificial intelligent technologies, artificial intelligence in education (AIED) has become an important research topic. Several studies have applied image recognition technologies to determine students’ learning status. However, little research has employed both sensor technology and image recognition technology in learning status analysis. Moreover, it remains unknown if learning status analysis is accurate enough to substitute for human observers. Furthermore, no feedback has been provided individually to students to manage their learning status by maintaining their attention in class. In this paper, a learning status management system in an intelligent classroom is proposed. Several types of information about students were detected and collected by both sensor technology and image recognition technology, and a Bayesian classification network was employed to inference the students’ learning status. Moreover, the system includes a feedback mechanism, which not only provides the results of the just-in-time learning status analysis to teachers, but also notifies students who are detected as being unfocused in class. Two experiments were conducted to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system. Results showed that the learning status analysis highly corresponded to the observation of human beings, and the students were more attentive in class. © 2021.

In the designed three-week learning activities, students were encouraged to put their ideas about AI into practice through two hands-on activities, utilizing a provided deep learning-based web service. This study designed pre-test and post-test surveys to investigate the performance of students in different aspects of AI. With 328 students involved in these learning activities, we discovered from the surveys that the proposed learning method can effectively improve AI literacy among non-engineering students. This study also found that students’ AI literacy correlated significantly with their awareness of AI ethical issues and that the STEM-based AI curriculum increased the awareness of AI ethical issues among low-AI-literate learners.

SRL is an internal process, but analytics can offer an externalisation trigger to allow for observable effects on learner behaviours. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between students' SRL competence and their learning engagement behaviours observed in multimodal data. In a postgraduate course with 42 students, eighteen features from three types of data in seven learning activities were extracted to investigate multi-level SRL competence students' engagement behaviours. The results revealed that students with different SRL competence clusters might exhibit different behaviours in individual, group, and cohort level learning activities. Also, students with similar SRL competence might exhibit significantly different engagement behaviours in different learning activities, depending on the learning design. Therefore, while using engagement data in AIED systems; the modality of the data, specific analysis techniques used to process it, and the contextual particularities of the learning design should all be explicitly presented. So that, they can be considered in the interpretations of automated decisions about student achievement.

Such a transformation of AI has led to a significant evolution in both academic and industrial fields. To understand the potential impact of AI evolution for future teaching and learning, it is necessary to re-examine the opportunities, research issues, and roles of AI in education as modern AI enables the possibility of playing vital roles in education, which are not only limited to intelligent tutors/tutees but also intelligent learning partners or policy making advisors. Motivated by the recent transformation and trends in AI in education, this special issue, including 12 research articles, aims to launch an in-depth discussion on re-examining AI and analytics techniques in teaching and learning applications. © 2021.

For students, learning AI helps them better cope with emerging societal, technological, and environmental challenges. This theory of planned behavior (TPB)-based study developed a survey questionnaire to measure behavioral intention to learn AI (n = 682) among primary school students. The questionnaire was administered online, and it measured responses to five TPB factors. The five factors were (1) self-efficacy in learning AI, (2) AI readiness, (3) perceptions of the use of AI for social good, (4) AI literacy, and (5) behavioral intention. Exploratory factor analysis and a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis were used to validate this five-factor survey. Both analyses indicated satisfactory construct validity. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to elucidate the factors’ influence on intention to learn AI. According to the SEM, all factors could predict intention to learn AI, whether directly or indirectly. This study provides new insights for researchers and instructors who are promoting AI education in schools. © 2021.

In education research, artificial intelligence (AI) is applicable in many situations, such as predicting students’ learning paths and strategies. In this study, we explore the benefits of repetitive practice of short-answer questions could enhance students’ long-term memory for subsequent improvements in learning performance. However, frequent authoring questions and grading requires teachers’ professionalism, experience, and considerable efforts. Therefore, this study using modern AI technologies, specifically natural language processing, to provide Automatic question generation (AQG) solution, a combined semantics-based and syntax-based question generation system: Hybrid automatic question generation (Hybrid-AQG) was proposed in this study. We assessed its functionality and student learning performance by asking 91 students to complete short-answer questions and then applied a process similar to the Turing test to evaluate the question and grading quality. The results demonstrated that modern AI technologies can generate highly realistic short-answer questions because: (1) Compared with the control group, the experimental group exhibited significantly better learning performance, implying that students acquired long-term memory of course knowledge through repetitive practice with machine-generated questioning. (2) The experimental group could better distinguish machine-generated and expert-authored questions. Nevertheless, both groups in distinguishing questions presented like guessing. (3) Machine grading was deficient in some respects; but the way students answer questions can be adapted for machine understanding through repetitive practice. © 2021.

However, the use of emerging technologies usually results in cognitive load, especially for elementary school students whose learning capacity has not yet been established. In addition, students of different genders have different physical, psychological and learning characteristics, so gender differences affect cognitive load. Cognitive load can be divided into two types: positive cognitive load and negative cognitive load. Usually, positive cognitive load results in good learning performance while negative cognitive load results in bad learning performance. Therefore, we use the cognitive load theory to define learning efficiency as the co-impact of learning performance and cognitive load. We take game-based intelligent robots for Chinese idiom learning as an example, and explore the impacts of gender differences on elementary school students. To achieve these aims, this study combined games and Zenbo robots, and applied them to educate elementary school students in the use of Chinese idioms. Secondly, this study conducted an experiment and analyzed the experimental results. The participants were 24 fourth-grade elementary school students from the central region of Taiwan. Results showed that this system is more beneficial for boys as their cognitive load was significantly lower. Boys’ learning performance was also better, although the difference did not reach significance. Furthermore, learning efficiency for boys was significantly higher. Reasons for these results are explained. © 2021.

Less frequent in discussions of artificial intelligence—both in how AI systems are presently in use, and how they may be deployed in the future—is mention of AI’s impact in the civilian public sphere. This is particularly true with respect to how AI is impacting, and will impact, public education systems around the world. In this chapter, we examine current uses of AI in public education in the United States, China, and India. We discuss government plans to expand those uses in the future. The Indian government is ahead of those in both China and the United States in articulating a vision for how AI can be used to reshape public education for the better. And we finally analyze these uses in the context of such considerations as school demographics, fairness, civil liberties and differing cultural views of privacy, and broader AI surveillance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  China;  Education;  Education Policy;  India;  United StatesDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusBryzgalina, E.V.57194202675;Artificial intelligence in education.

AI technologies will be able to bring education management closer to usage of methods based on a significant amount of quality data and contribute to the formation of evidence-based educational policy, when it will be applied to the systemic aspect of education. Problems with the interpretation of the decision-making model in administration directly affects on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence support for managerial decisions in the education. The process of education and upbringing can be personalized and individualized with the support of AI through the formation of individual educational programs by format, by content, by the educational environment; methodological support of training courses; increasing the motivation and involvement of students. The transformation of interaction models between educational subjects is ambiguous in terms of the impact on the autonomy and responsibility of the subjects, on the results of socialization and upbringing, on the labor intensity and transparency of the educational process, including in the light of the prospects for the emergence of “human–AI” systems as a trained agent. In the effective aspect, education involves AI as a tool for monitoring and recording educational achievements and expended resources, capable of clarifying the links between educational activities and results. The digital educational footprint, becoming a commodity, generates a number of conflicts regarding the autonomy of subjects and the status of personal data. The key risks of using AI in education are associated in the article with the problems of human existential security and the anthropological essence of education. Their assessment is limited by the Collingridge dilemma, in the solution of which a comprehensive socio-humanitarian examination of the goals and practices of using AI in education is important, part of which is the development in the field of education philosophy. © 2021, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The medical community and national and federal regulatory bodies are recognizing the importance of adapting to AI. However, there is a gap in physicians’ understanding of AI and its implications regarding its potential use in clinical care, and there are limited resources and established programs focused on AI and medical education in ophthalmology. Physicians are essential in the application of AI in a clinical context. An AI curriculum in ophthalmology can help provide physicians with a fund of knowledge and skills to integrate AI into their practice. In this paper, we provide general recommendations for an AI curriculum for medical students, residents, and fellows in ophthalmology. © 2021 The Authors.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Curriculum;  Medical education;  TechnologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusZhang, Y., Qin, G., Cheng, L., Marimuthu, K., Kumar, B.S.57224834397;57224806727;57224828571;57190179294;56448984500;Interactive smart educational system using ai for students in the higher education platform(2021) Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic and Soft Computing, 36 (1), pp. 83-98.

Particularly in the field of education, AI applications promise immense innovation potential. A central focus in this field is on analyzing and evaluating learner characteristics to derive learning profiles and create individualized learning environments. The development and implementation of such AI-driven approaches are related to learners' data, and thus involves several privacies, ethics, and morality challenges. In this paper, we introduce the concept of human-centered AI, and consider how an AI system can be developed in line with human values without posing risks to humanity. Because the education market is in the early stages of incorporating AI into educational tools, we believe that this is the right time to raise awareness about the use of principles that foster human-centered values and help in building responsible, ethical, and value-oriented AI. © 2021 Carleton University.

Estonia is promoting technological innovation in education. According to the Index of Readiness for Digital Lifelong Learning (IRDLL), Estonia was ranked first among 27 European countries. In this context, our goal was to explore teachers’ perceptions about cutting-edge technologies (in this case, AI) and to contextualize our results in the scope of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE). We carried out a survey with 140 Estonian K-12 teachers and we asked them about their understanding and concerns regarding the use of AI in education and the challenges they face. The analysis of the survey responses suggests that teachers have limited knowledge about AI and how it could support them in practice. Nonetheless, they perceive it as an opportunity for education. The results indicate that teachers need support in order to be efficient and effective in their work practice; we envision that AI can be used to provide this support. Furthermore, we identified challenges that relate to the socio-cultural context of the study: for example, teachers perceived AI as a tool to support them in accessing, adapting and using multilingual content. To conclude, we discuss the findings of this work in relation to ethical AI, and elaborate on the implications and future aspects of this work in the context of FATE and participatory design of learning environments. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Challenges;  Classrooms;  Education;  FATE;  TeachersDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusWei, S., Huang, P., Li, R., Liu, Z., Zou, Y.57224177333;57224173346;57224163667;57224174841;57219012253;Exploring the Application of Artificial Intelligence in Sports Training: A Case Study Approach(2021) Complexity, 2021, art. no. 4658937, .

As a key technology in the modern society, AI is increasingly affecting all aspects of people's daily lives, including sports training. AI can be considered as an assistive technology to provide specific support to athletes' physical education training through various means such as data analysis and simulation of training scenarios. Although research on AI is still in the preliminary stage, it is significant to explore how AI can be applied in sports training since this emerging technology could facilitate people's physical training to some extent. This paper first reviews the existing research on AI applications. Then, based on the fundamental concept and related research results of AI, this study explores three specific cases of AI application in sports training and explains the main principles. This research focuses on discussing the strong relationship between AI technology and physical education training and highlights the advantages of AI, including utilization, convenience, and innovation. © 2021 Shiqing Wei et al.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusDe Oliveira Fornasier, M.57216693559;Legal Education in the 21st Century and the Artificial Intelligence [Ensino Jurídico No Século Xxi E A Inteligência Artificial](2021) Revista Opiniao Juridica, 19 (31), pp. 1-32.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106738430&doi=10.12662%2f2447-6641OJ.V19I31.P1-32.2021&partnerID=40&md5=38f6b617ca79f5dbc9a7569569414da7DOI: 10.12662/2447-6641OJ.V19I31.P1-32.2021ABSTRACT: We sought to study the main reflexes of the digital economy that influence legal education, and some of the operational suggestions that accompany criticisms of that process. To this end, some of the main suggestions made by experts in law and education to transform legal education in the face of the technological ubiquity scenario were observed. In a second moment, the transformations that higher education has been undergoing with the introduction of AI in the market and in universities were specifically analyzed. Finally, both the reflexes of AI in legal education and suggestions related to transformations that legal education must undergo were studied. Methodology: The hypothetical-deductive procedure method was used, with a qualitative and technical approach of bibliographic-documentary research, in this exploratory and interdisciplinary research. Results: It was identified that legal education will have to move away from a retrospective epistemological stance, and evolve towards a prospective and projective stance, incorporating knowledge from technological areas and quantitative methodologies, without neglecting the exercise of traditional normative skills, communicative and narrative values that are highly evaluated by law professionals, thus emphasizing the need to foster student creativity. It is also concluded that higher education courses should incorporate coding in their curricula, in parallel with encouraging students' creativity and their communicative skills-however, a regulation should be developed in parallel, which must take into account the ethical risks of the use of AI in teaching. Finally, it is clear that the legal professions are not yet under a very pressing possibility of substitution by AI, but universities must make students aware that there are specific tasks in the legal professions that may be replaced by AI tools in order to advise them to focus on tasks that cannot be replaced by machines. © 2020 Centro Universitario Christus.

Though adoption rates are currently low, colleges and universities will likely incorporate some aspects of machine teachers (e.g., AI, robots) in their curriculums in the foreseeable future. However, little is known about how to create an effective machine teacher-based education. As an initial step, the present study examines whether an AI instructor’s communication style would have an impact on students’ perceptions about an AI instructor-based education. To test this inquiry, the study conducted an online experiment using a 2 (communication styles: functional vs. relational) x 2 (course topic: natural science vs. social science) between-subjects design. Primary results indicate that students develop more favorable perceptions about an AI instructor-based education when the AI instructor is relational rather than functional. This tendency is particularly strong when listening to a social science lecture. Further, social presence of an AI instructor functions as a mediator, which explains the reason why a relational AI instructor leads to more favorable perceptions about an AI instructor-based education is because of one’s social presence of an AI instructor.

There were two stages in the study. The inclusion criteria for selecting participants were healthy adults in local community with no known medical diagnosis. Those with a history of mental health problems, mood disorders, and cardiovascular and pulmonary problems were excluded. At Stage 1, subjects were asked to categorize the selected video clips downloaded from YouTube into happiness, sadness, and others. The subjects in Stage 1 did not participate in Stage 2. At Stage 2, the videos were presented randomly via computer to each subject who could, immediately after he/she had watched a video clip, input his/her respective emotion ratings through a touch-screen monitor. Simultaneously his/her HRV was captured using a Polar watch with chest belt during the entire Stage 2. A total of 239 subjects participated in the study. Of them, 158 (66.1%) were female and 81 (33.9%) were male. The mean ages for females and males were 34.10 (sd ​= ​18.11) and 37.51 (sd ​= ​18.35) respectively. In the Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) model, a sensitivity of 70.7% that the model correctly identified a subject's happiness, while a specificity of 58.4% that the model correctly identified sadness. Prediction of the emotions of happiness and sadness using HRV measures was supported. HRV measures does provide an objective method to assess the emotions. Further work could be done to explore the prediction of other emotions. © 2021 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Emotion;  Happiness;  HRV;  Prediction;  SadnessDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusKabudi, T., Pappas, I., Olsen, D.H.57220834021;55387371600;7202416827;AI-enabled adaptive learning systems: A systematic mapping of the literature(2021) Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 2, art. no. 100017, .

In recent years, there has been an emergence of more advanced AI-enabled learning systems, which are gaining traction due to their ability to deliver learning content and adapt to the individual needs of students. Yet, even though these contemporary learning systems are useful educational platforms that meet students’ needs, there is still a low number of implemented systems designed to address the concerns and problems faced by many students. Based on this perspective, a systematic mapping of the literature on AI-enabled adaptive learning systems was performed in this work. A total of 147 studies published between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. The major findings and contributions of this paper include the identification of the types of AI-enabled learning interventions used, a visualisation of the co-occurrences of authors associated with major research themes in AI-enabled learning systems and a review of common analytical methods and related techniques utilised in such learning systems. This mapping can serve as a guide for future studies on how to better design AI-enabled learning systems to solve specific learning problems and improve users’ learning experiences. © 2021 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive learning systems;  AI;  AI-Enabled learning systemsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusVicari, R.M.55666982300;Influências das Tecnologias da Inteligência Artificial no ensino(2021) Estudos Avancados, 35 (101), pp. 73-84.

During this period, two “winters” (1980 and 1993) can be highlighted where applications were interesting, but AI was not able to provide adequate responses, for example, in understanding language and in medical diagnosis. On the other hand, AI enjoyed two decades of progress (2000 and 2010), where the applications remained, but AI responses advanced in automatic translation (Google), image recognition (Apple was the first to use the technology, on its iPhone X), cancer diagnosis (IBM’s Watson) and autonomous cars (among others, Tesla).

Such systems can be software-based and operate in a virtual world. Examples of such systems include voice synthesizers, image analysis software, search engines, speech, and facial recognition systems. This study seeks to answer the questions – (i) how artificial intelligence could be applied in social studies and specifically – in education and media and communication research? and (ii) what multidisciplinary challenges face a social researcher seeking to empower artificial intelligence methods? Since the topic is very new and slightly researched, a meta-narrative review was chosen as the best methodological tool to provide answers to the research question and an overview of a certain research field. Relatively few scientific articles analyzing applications of AI in qualitative studies have been found. This study analyzed theoretical articles examining the challenges of AI in education, and media and communication fields. Results showed, that in educational research, artificial intelligence is used in the personalization of the learning process, monitoring, and testing learner activities, designing the learning process, and assisting in peer interaction and other learning activities. In media and communications research, AI helps to detect and track data, discovers unwanted content, creates and designs news, analyzes content and context, human behavior, and many more. Qualitative researchers should pay special attention to ethical; policy; technological; and social AI challenges. This study inspired a new AI research agenda; helped to identify the gaps in the implication of artificial intelligence in social research and strengthened multidisciplinary discussion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in education;  AI in media and communications;  AI systems;  Meta-narrative reviewDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusXu, Z., Wei, Y., Zhang, J.57223007918;57223005758;57223005460;AI Applications in Education(2021) Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST, 356 LNICST, pp. 326-339.

There is also the need to consider explicitly issues such as fairness, accountability, transparency, bias, autonomy, agency, and inclusion. At a more general level, there is also a need to differentiate between doing ethical things and doing things ethically, to understand and to make pedagogical choices that are ethical, and to account for the ever-present possibility of unintended consequences. However, addressing these and related questions is far from trivial. As a first step towards addressing this critical gap, we invited 60 of the AIED community’s leading researchers to respond to a survey of questions about ethics and the application of AI in educational contexts. In this paper, we first introduce issues around the ethics of AI in education. Next, we summarise the contributions of the 17 respondents, and discuss the complex issues that they raised. Specific outcomes include the recognition that most AIED researchers are not trained to tackle the emerging ethical questions. A well-designed framework for engaging with ethics of AIED that combined a multidisciplinary approach and a set of robust guidelines seems vital in this context. © 2021, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Agency;  Artificial intelligence in education;  Ethics;  Fairness;  Human cognition;  PedagogyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusMunshi, A.A., Alhindi, A.56428688000;55632703100;Big Data Platform for Educational Analytics(2021) IEEE Access, 9, art. no. 9393907, pp. 52883-52890.

Nowadays, the educational data is evolving and has become large in volume, wide in variety and high in velocity. This produced data needs to be handled in an efficient manner to extract value and make informed decisions. For that, this paper confronts such data as a big data challenge and presents a comprehensive platform tailored to perform educational big data analytical applications. Further, present an effective environment for non-data scientists and people in the educational sector to apply their demanding educational big data applications. The implementation stages of the educational big data platform on a cloud computing platform and the organization of educational data in a data lake architecture are highlighted. Furthermore, two analytical applications are performed to test the feasibility of the presented platform in discovering knowledge that potentially promotes the educational institutions. © 2013 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence in education;  education;  educational big data;  educational data miningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusChetyrbok, P.V., Shostak, M.A., Alimova, L.U.57195324976;57210750795;57222579650;Adaptive learning using artificial intelligence in distance education(2021) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2834, pp. 61-70.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103290072&partnerID=40&md5=dcd782a281a8236bc094a057c9458decABSTRACT: Reviewed and analyzed is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in distance education.

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives. © 2021 The Author(s)AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Explainable AI;  Human-centered AI;  Interpretable ML;  Smart learning;  Sustainable AIDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusSoong, T.K., Ho, C.-M.57208794379;35721996500;Artificial intelligence in medical OSCEs: Reflections and future developments(2021) Advances in Medical Education and Practice, 12, pp. 167-173.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102944204&doi=10.2147%2fAMEP.S287926&partnerID=40&md5=2dd4a3ea1cfc76f6ca35b4341e1d0295DOI: 10.2147/AMEP.S287926ABSTRACT: With the advent of the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we seek to consider how AI could shape clinical examinations, specifically Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). OSCEs, whilst having its own limitations, could be further enhanced with new technologies like AI to help better assess and prepare our future clinicians. With the everchanging requirements on the modern clinician, we deliberate the strengths and weaknesses of AI, and the need for emphasis on different skills to complement rather than resist the tides of change. In conclusion, we feel that AI has the potential to be a strong driving force in remodelling OSCEs to support future doctors and could serve as a new frontier in medical education and beyond. That being said, we recognize the technology and its applications are still in its infancy, and further study will be needed to eluciate the role of AI in medical education and in the greater landscape of medical practice. © 2021 Soong and Ho.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Assessment;  Future doctor;  Medical education;  PerspectiveDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusYang, S.J.H.25924575100;Guest Editorial: Precision Education - A New Challenge for AI in Education(2021) Educational Technology and Society, 24 (1), pp. 105-108.

One of the recent AI applications introduced to Education is the Chatbot technology, used to support teaching and administrative tasks. A long standing problem in Computer Science Education (CSE) is how to improve program comprehension for novice programmers. So far, CSE has not seen any Chatbot for supporting the teaching of programming. This paper proposed a Chatbot named Python-Bot that helps novice programmers to un-derstand Python’s basic syntactic structures and semantics. Python-Bot was implemented on an existing Chatbot API (called SnatchBot) and an evaluation was performed to prove the effectiveness of Python-Bot. The results suggest that Python-Bot can support novice programmers in the comprehension of programs written in Python.

A prototype VR application was developed to give students an introduction to deep learning using the Oculus Quest. The application applied escape room elements as an attempt to let students learn the curriculum in an engaging way by doing 3D-puzzles, calculations, and quizzes based on the course-material. The topics were split into separate rooms to let students progress through the curriculum intuitively. 15 people tested the application and responded to a questionnaire. 26 people evaluated the application’s concepts after watching a video. Based on the evaluation, we believe that using such a VR application in AI education can be a good supplementary tool to introduce students to new topics in an engaging way. The main advantage of using VR in this context is to use interactive 3D-visualizations and hands-on activities that are challenging to experience by other means. The questionnaire’s respondents were very positive to the concept, and it could potentially be beneficial in other types of STEM-education as well. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Deep learning;  Educational escape room;  Immersive learning;  Learning technologies;  Mobile learning;  Virtual realityDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSrinivasan, R., Uchino, K.57213029012;56597563500;The role of arts in shaping AI ethics(2021) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2812, pp. 1-6.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101201598&partnerID=40&md5=1dadc0b933af226f4dda649f7c5def66ABSTRACT: Despite the significant progress made in recent years, there seems to be a visible bottleneck in transforming artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into large scale systems of ethical value. Biases in training data coupled with algorithmic biases adversely affect many stakeholders. It has been shown that AI based decisions exhibit discrimination based on sensitive attributes such as age, gender, and race, to name a few. One of the ways of addressing this issue is by incorporating the voices of people impacted by AI into the AI pipeline. However, historical power structures and impacts of discrimination against specific communities worldwide poses several challenges. Towards this end, art shows tremendous promise as a powerful platform to promote AI education, as a medium of expression, and to enhance empathy; thereby facilitating diversity and inclusion in the AI pipeline. In this work, we highlight some emerging work in this area, discuss pathways that art offers towards enhancing AI ethics, and outline some open research directions.

With the rapid AI development process and its near instant global coverage, the issues of applicable ethical principles and guidelines have become vital. AI promises to deliver a lot of advantages to economic, social and educational fields. Since AI is also increasingly applied in healthcare and medical education areas, ethical application issues are growing ever more important. Ethical and social issues raised by AI in healthcare overlap with those raised by personal data use, function automation, reliance on assistive medical technologies and the so-called ‘telehealth’. Without well-grounded ethical guidelines or even regulatory framework in respect of the AI in healthcare several legal and ethical problems at the implementational level can arise. In order to facilitate further discussion about the ethical principles and responsibilities of educational system in healthcare using AI and to potentially arrive at a consensus concerning safe and desirable uses of AI in healthcare education, this paper performs an evaluation of the self-imposed AI ethical guidelines identifying the common principles and approaches as well as drawbacks limiting the practical and legal application of internal policies. The main aim of the research is to encourage integration of theoretical studies and policy studies on sustainability issues in correlation between healthcare and technologies, the AI ethical perspective. © 2021, European Center of Sustainable Development.

It can make full use of the advantages of the network across regions, and make full use of the advantages of network technology to share the resources of colleges and universities, which is a promising educational method. In response to the demand of online education for learner information, this paper proposes the learner model Neighbor Mean Variation Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (NMVMOPSO-GA). This model includes the learner's learning interest sub-model, the learner's cognitive ability sub-model and the learner's knowledge sub-model. The modelling techniques of the three sub-models are discussed separately, and their status and role in the online education system are analyzed. At the same time, for the knowledge model that reflects the learner's learning progress and knowledge mastery, a learner knowledge sub-model constructed with Bayesian networks is proposed. The neighbor mean mutation operator is introduced to optimize the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and improve the convergence performance and stability of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. We study the application of multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in online course resource generation service. Through simulation experiments, it is verified that the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm can improve the performance and stability of online course resource generation. © 2021 - IOS Press.

It is an educational method that promotes the healthy development of students' physical fitness and encourages students to actively take physical exercises. It is an individual evaluation standard for students' physical fitness. It is also one of the necessary conditions for students to graduate. In order to improve the physique and health of college students, this article first introduces functional exercise tests to comprehensively measure the exercise capacity of the main muscle groups and joints of the human body, and integrate flexibility and strength qualities. Secondly, this article quantitatively studies the interaction law between the natural light environment comfort of sports training facilities and architectural design elements, and adopts appropriate dynamic optimization methods to improve the light environment quality of the sports space, thereby enhancing the visual comfort of the sports crowd in the stadium. Finally, the artificial intelligence technology is introduced, through the design of artificial intelligence system, intelligent data collection, and analysis. From the perspective of physical education, the functional exercise test based on artificial intelligence conforms to the essential meaning of the physical fitness test and helps to enhance the awareness of college students' physical exercise. And the intelligent remote multimedia physical education system based on artificial intelligence makes the physical education process flexible, free from time and place restrictions, and can adopt different teaching strategies according to the different situations of students to implement personalized teaching. © 2021 - IOS Press.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the concept of smart education has been constantly improved and gradually penetrated into all aspects of education application. Considering the dominant position of classroom teaching in elementary and undergraduate education, the introduction of AI technology into inclass teaching evaluation has become a research hotspot. In this paper, we propose a statistical modeling and ensemble learning-based comprehensive model, which is oriented towards in-class teaching evaluation by using AI technologies such as computer vision (CV) and intelligent speech recognition (ISR). Firstly, we present an index system including a set of teaching evaluation indicators combining traditional assessment scales with new values derived from CV and ISR-based AI analysis. Next, we design a comprehensive in-class teaching evaluation model by using both the analytic hierarchy process-entropy weight (AHP-EW) and AdaBoost-based ensemble learning (AdaBoost- EL) methods. Experiments not only demonstrate that the two modules in the model are respectively applicable to the calculation of indicators with different characteristics, but also verify the performance of the proposed model for AI-based in-class teaching evaluation. In this comprehensive inclass evaluation model, for students’ concentration and participation, ensemble learning module is chosen with less root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.318 and 9.375. In addition, teachers’ media usage and teachers’ type evaluated by statistical modeling module approach higher accuracy with 0.905 and 0.815. Instead, the ensemble learning approaches the accuracy of 0.73 in evaluating teachers’ style, which performs better than the statistical modeling module with the accuracy of 0.69. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessment of patients’ need for education and support is very important for patients’ counselling and follow-up. Aim: To evaluate acceptance of illness and need for education to support dermatology self-care in Arabic patients with psoriasis. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study using a survey was conducted. The survey collected patients’ demographics, disease characteristics, Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS) and Person-Centered Dermatology Self-Care Index (PeDeSI). Outcome measures were presented in total and in relation to age, gender, disease duration, disease severity, quality of life and level of education. The correlation between AIS and PeDeSI was examined using Spearman’s rank correlation test. Results: In total, 209 psoriatic patients from 12 Arabic countries participated in the survey with mean ± SD age of 35.8 ±10.0 years. The median (IQR) AIS score was 28 (19–35). The median (IQR) of the PeDeSI score was 15 (11–22). Both AIS and PeDeSI did not differ in relation to age, gender, disease duration, and level of education. However, patients with a higher impairment in quality of life reported lower levels of illness acceptance (p = 0.001) and a higher need for education and support (p = 0.004). AIS and PeDeSI were moderately correlated (rho = 0.33, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Arabic psoriatic patients showed moderate acceptance of illness and required some education to support dermatology self-care. Greater clinical attention with focus on patient education and counselling should be given to Arabic patients with psoriasis especially those with more impaired quality of life. © 2021 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

However, this sequencing, called Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS), represents a problem that falls in the NP-Hard class of problems given the diversity of sequences that could be chosen from ever-larger repositories of learning materials. Thus, metaheuristics are usually employed to tackle this problem. This study aims to present a systematic review and mapping of the literature to identify, analyze, and classify the published solutions related to the ACS problem addressed by metaheuristics. We considered 61 studies in the mapping and 58 studies in the review from 2005 to 2018. Even though the problem is longstanding, it is still discussed, especially considering new modeling and used metaheuristics. In this sense, we emphasize the use of Swarm Intelligence and Genetic Algorithm. Moreover, we have identified that various parameters were considered for students and knowledge domain modeling, however, few student’s intrinsic parameters have been explored in ACS literature. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive learning;  Artificial intelligence in education;  Evolutionary computing;  Intelligent tutoring systems;  Knowledge domain modeling;  Learning path;  Student modelingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusJones, J., Masika, R.57001731400;56016876700;Appreciative inquiry as a developmental research approach for higher education pedagogy: space for the shadow(2021) Higher Education Research and Development, 40 (2), pp. 279-292.

An overview of AI considering the methodological dilemma of focusing only on positive experiences is discussed. Findings from focus group discussions in a post-1992 UK university are presented that demonstrate AI’s efficacy as a developmental pedagogic research approach. This AI research was part of the wider UK retention and success project, ‘What Works?’, which aimed to support first year undergraduates’ belonging during HE transition in order to enhance their engagement, retention and success. These focus groups explored first year undergraduates’ experiences of learning, teaching, assessment and support, incorporating retention interventions in Business, Social Science and Digital Media courses. Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus and capital and Wenger’s community of practice model are applied as an analytical lens to illuminate the role of structure and agency relating to students’ experiences. The findings show how AI focus groups were a way for participants to explore and discuss positive perceptions and experiences of starting university. They also enabled participants to discuss problems, solutions, and ways to enhance pedagogy and support, contributing to educational development at course, institutional and sector-wide levels. We argue that embracing the ‘shadow’ (Fitzgerald, S. P., Oliver, C., & Hoxsey, J. C. (2010). Appreciative inquiry as a shadow process. Journal of Management Inquiry, 19(3), 220–233) in AI is a commitment that should be shared by a variety of stakeholders in order to gain a holistic understanding of what is needed to facilitate transformative change in HE development. © 2020 HERDSA.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: action research;  Appreciative inquiry;  higher education development;  transformative changeDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusBarnes-Najor, J.V., Thompson, N.L., Cameron, A.F., Smith, T.M., Calac Verdugo, M., Brown, P.L., Sarche, M.C.56856192600;56879783200;57214945307;57216348969;57216350892;57216340017;24391721400;Cultural and Practice Perspectives on the Classroom Assessment Scoring System: Voices From American Indian and Alaska Native Head Start Programs(2021) Journal of Research in Childhood Education, 35 (1), pp. 162-183.

Based on qualitative data from 76 AI/AN Head Start administrators, our findings provide evidence that there are advantages and limitations in using the CLASS in AI/AN Head Start programs. While two of the three broad constructs measured by the CLASS fit well with the experiences of AI/AN early childhood education programs, our data provide evidence of cultural misalignment in the CLASS trainings, some of the CLASS behavioral markers, and the Instructional Support domain. Based upon our findings, we suggest further work be conducted to understand how to modify the instrument or create a new instrument to be better aligned with AI/AN Head Start classroom experiences. © 2020 Childhood Education International.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: American Indian and Alaska Native;  cross-cultural measurement;  early childhood classroom observation;  Head StartDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKim, J., Merrill, K., Xu, K., Sellnow, D.D.36681393800;57205125252;57193532942;12791510900;My Teacher Is a Machine: Understanding Students’ Perceptions of AI Teaching Assistants in Online Education(2020) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 36 (20), pp. 1902-1911.

In fact, AI teaching assistants have already been implemented in a small number of courses in the United States. However, little is known about how students will perceive AI teaching assistants. Thus, the present study investigated students’ perceptions about AI teaching assistants in higher education by use of an online survey. Primary findings indicate that perceived usefulness of an AI teaching assistant and perceived ease of communication with an AI teaching assistant are key to understanding an eventual adoption of AI teaching assistant-based education. These findings provide support for AI teaching assistant adoption. Based on the present study’s findings, more research is needed to better understand the nuances associated with the learning experience one may have from an AI teaching assistant. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusXu, L.57222570697;The Dilemma and Countermeasures of AI in Educational Application(2020) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 289-294.

With the continuous integration of AI technology and education, although we see a bright future in the field of AI in education, it can be seen that many obstacles will still exist in the future by reviewing the tortuous and difficult development history of AI in education for decades. Due to the dilemmas such as the inexplicability of algorithm, the limitations of algorithm, data bias, privacy leakage, etc., the application of AI in the education may face difficulties and obstacles in technology, effect, law, ethics, and system level, etc. Logically proposing the countermeasures to meet the development of AI education will be very helpful in dealing well with the difficulties and obstacles effectively. Abiding by the principles such as transparency, integration, diversification, popularization, fairness, accountability, security, privacy protection, humanistic education and other principlesand ways is to effectively apply AI in education, thereby promoting the technological integration in the development of educational innovation safely and effectively. © 2020 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  Algorithm;  Countermeasure;  Education applicationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusKushnarev, S., Kang, K., Goyal, S.35092729200;57191663860;57209162130;Assessing the efficacy of personalized online homework in a first-year engineering multivariate calculus course(2020) Proceedings of 2020 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering, TALE 2020, art. no. 9368417, pp. 770-773.

In order to further analyze how teachers' gestures can improve teaching effects and quality, and to make up for the lack of teaching gestures image recognition function and action anthropomorphism, which are currently lacking in educational robots, it is necessary to analyze the different gestures used by teachers in teaching. The key point is how scientific and efficient to recognize all kinds of gestures used by the teachers. Based on the unique convolutional layer and pooling layer structure of convolutional neural network, this paper analyzed five types of online teaching gestures images marked by the human key points detection, including indicative gestures, one-hand beat gestures, two-hand beat gestures, frontal habitual gestures, and lateral habitual gestures. An online teaching gestures recognition model with a ten-layer convolutional neural network is established. The error of this model is minimized by error back propagation and gradient descent algorithms, and the corresponding model parameters are obtained. The model is verified by the test set, and the training accuracy of the model is as high as 96%. The model can be applied to analyze the influence of the teachers' teaching gestures on the teaching effect and quality, at the same time, it can improve the intelligence and anthropomorphism of educational robots in the field of computer vision and its human-computer interaction. © 2020 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence in education;  convolutional neural network;  deep learning;  educational robot;  gestures recognition model;  online teachingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSong, L., Petsangsri, S.57225913835;57188988021;Smart Scenic Area Construction Framework for Meeting Demands of Multiple Interests Based on Global Tourism Architecture: An Approach to Educating Smart Scenic Area Construction Framework(2020) Proceedings - Companion of the 2020 IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability, and Security, QRS-C 2020, art. no. 9282670, pp. 527-534.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted several aspects of healthcare. However, few studies have focused on medical education. We performed an AI-assisted education study and confirmed that AI can accelerate trainees’ medical image learning. Materials: We developed an AI-based medical image learning system to highlight hip fracture on a plain pelvic film. Thirty medical students were divided into a conventional (CL) group and an AI-assisted learning (AIL) group. In the CL group, the participants received a prelearning test and a postlearning test. In the AIL group, the participants received another test with AI-assisted education before the postlearning test. Then, we analyzed changes in diagnostic accuracy. Results: The prelearning performance was comparable in both groups. In the CL group, postlearning accuracy (78.66 ± 14.53) was higher than prelearning accuracy (75.86 ± 11.36) with no significant difference (p =.264). The AIL group showed remarkable improvement. The WithAI score (88.87 ± 5.51) was significantly higher than the prelearning score (75.73 ± 10.58, p < 0.01). Moreover, the postlearning score (84.93 ± 14.53) was better than the prelearning score (p < 0.01). The increase in accuracy was significantly higher in the AIL group than in the CL group. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the viability of AI for augmenting medical education. Integrating AI into medical education requires dynamic collaboration from research, clinical, and educational perspectives. © 2020, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Deep learning;  Fracture;  Medical image education;  Personalized educationDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusCantú-Ortiz, F.J., Galeano Sánchez, N., Garrido, L., Terashima-Marin, H., Brena, R.F.6701563520;21833250600;12754177700;13609297000;6602296514;An artificial intelligence educational strategy for the digital transformation(2020) International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing, 14 (4), pp. 1195-1209.

The goal is to support institutions of higher education to build curricula that help companies by providing them with qualified human capital to face the challenges of the twenty first century that have brought about the work environment now referred to as Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The strategy consists of a business intelligence summary of AI trends and challenges of interest to academic institutions with an emphasis in intelligent human–computer communication and interactive design and manufacturing for educating engineers for the future enterprise. We also present a case study that builds upon 35 years of experience in offering AI academic programs in the institution, Tecnologico de Monterrey (Tec) to educate future engineers and knowledge workers. The components of our case study comprise graduate and undergraduate courses, research, internships, innovation, internationalization initiatives, and entrepreneurship. In this period, more than 5200 students have been trained at the Ph.D., MSc, and undergraduate levels with intense use of technology in the AI field. Now, the curricula of the university have been overhauled and renewed according to a new educative model known as the Tec21 Educative Model. The course offerings under this model are structured with challenge-based-learning, physical and virtual practice labs, and mixed teaching methodologies to accommodate the digital transformation and demands of Industry 4.0 to educate and prepare the new generation of students. The strategy and case study presented may be useful guides for other higher education institutions implementing AI academic programs to educate students demanded by the companies of the XXI century. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Digital transformation;  Industry 4.0;  Interactive engineering in education;  Tec21 educational modelDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusFeng, S., Kirkley, A.57190013027;57202741769;Mixing Patterns in Interdisciplinary Co-Authorship Networks at Multiple Scales(2020) Scientific Reports, 10 (1), art. no. 7731, .

This raises the question: Does interdisciplinary research collaboration necessarily result in disciplinary diversity among collaborators? We aim to explore this question by assessing collaborative preferences in interdisciplinary research at multiple scales through the examinination of disciplinary mixing patterns at the individual, dyadic, and team level in a coauthor network from the field of artificial intelligence in education, an emerging interdisciplinary area. Our key finding is that disciplinary diversity is reflected by diverse research experiences of individual researchers rather than diversity within pairs or groups of researchers. We also examine intergroup mixing by applying a novel approach to classify the active and non-active researchers in the collaboration network based on participation in multiple teams. We find a significant difference in indicators of academic performance and experience between the clusters of active and non-active researchers, suggesting intergroup mixing as a key factor in academic success. Our results shed light on the nature of team formation in interdisciplinary research, as well as highlight the importance of interdisciplinary training. © 2020, The Author(s).DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusSit, C., Srinivasan, R., Amlani, A., Muthuswamy, K., Azam, A., Monzon, L., Poon, D.S.56467900100;57214790967;57004686600;56287791200;57214791772;57195759287;57216850330;Attitudes and perceptions of UK medical students towards artificial intelligence and radiology: a multicentre survey(2020) Insights into Imaging, 11 (1), art. no. 14, .

Eighty-eight percent of students believed that AI will play an important role in healthcare, and 49% reported they were less likely to consider a career in radiology due to AI. Eighty-nine percent of students believed that teaching in AI would be beneficial for their careers, and 78% agreed that students should receive training in AI as part of their medical degree. Only 45 students received any teaching on AI; none of the students received such teaching as part of their compulsory curriculum. Statistically, students that did receive teaching in AI were more likely to consider radiology (p = 0.01) and rated more positively to the questions relating to the perceived competence in the post-graduation use of AI (p = 0.01–0.04); despite this, a large proportion of students in the taught group reported a lack of confidence and understanding required for the critical use of healthcare AI tools. Conclusions: UK medical students understand the importance of AI and are keen to engage. Medical school training on AI should be expanded and improved. Realistic use cases and limitations of AI must be presented to students so they will not feel discouraged from pursuing radiology. © 2020, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Education;  Medical student;  RadiologyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusGang, L.57220784038;Innovative Research on the Teaching Mode of Piano Group Lessons in Higher Vocational Preschool Education Based on AI(2020) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1651 (1), art. no. 012006, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097607907&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1651%2f1%2f012006&partnerID=40&md5=4e496a30eac55f4765e642ae58b23d90DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1651/1/012006ABSTRACT: The current AI technology has penetrated into many aspects of the education field (as shown in figure 1), and has made innovations in teaching models, courses and systems.

When a revolution happens, the consequences are not obvious straight away, and to date, there is no uniformly adapted framework to guide AI research to ensure a sustainable societal transition. To answer this need, here we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and scientific communities. Our analysis is of interest not only to AI practitioners but also to other researchers and the general public as it offers ways to guide the emerging collaborations and interactions toward the most fruitful outcomes.

While substantial research into the model and item design aspects of formative assessment has been conducted, few software systems embodied with a psychometric model have been proposed to allow us to adaptively implement formative assessments. This study aimed to develop an adaptive formative assessment system, called computerized formative adaptive testing (CAFT) by using artificial intelligence methods based on computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and Bayesian networks as learning analytics. CAFT can adaptively administer personalized formative assessment to a learner by dynamically selecting appropriate items and tests aligned with the learner’s ability. Forty items in an item bank were evaluated by 410 learners, moreover, 1000 learners were recruited for a simulation study and 120 learners were enrolled to evaluate the efficiency, validity, and reliability of CAFT in an application study. The results showed that, through CAFT, learners can adaptively take item s and tests in order to receive personalized diagnostic feedback about their learning progression. Consequently, this study highlights that a learning management system which integrates CAT as an artificially intelligent component is an efficient educational evaluation tool for a remote personalized learning service. © 2020 by the authors.

AI has been applied to resources to improve skills giving teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability and drive performance. This paper, written for policymakers in the field of education, highlights the impact of AI and advancements in academic policy. These academic policymakers generate ideas and strategies for applying AI across various disciplines. There is also discussion around AI implementation in education throughout developing nations for moving towards and ensuring affordable, high-quality education for every individual. Education for sustainable development (ESD) aims to promote the development of knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions necessary to build a sustainable world, to protect and preserve the environment, and promote social equity and economic sustainability. This paper analyses how AI can be used to update learning probabilities by providing examples of how it can be integrated with existing educational systems, using data to improve educational capital and quality in developing countries. It goes on to discuss whether policymakers and institutions can reinvent and rework educational programs to polish graduates’ skills for the growing presence of AI across all disciplines. There are four main parts to this work: (1) different dimensions regarding the complexities and potential implications, (2) the pros and cons of educational sustainability policy related to AI, (3) carving out AI and its outstanding execution, and finally (4) the linkage of AI with higher education within the context of educational expansions. In conclusion, the paper focuses on AI’s applications, benefits and sustainable development education challenges. © 2020 by the authors.

Where many AI processes are technologies hidden from view of the citizen, how can public institutions support and ensure these high levels of trust, transparency, and openness in Nordic culture and extend these concepts of “digital trust” to AI? One solution is by authoring national policy that upholds cultural values and personal rights, ultimately reinforcing these values in their societies. The paper highlights differences in how Nordic nations position themselves using cultural values as organizing principles, with the author showing these values (i.e., trust through clear information and information security, transparency through AI literacy education and clear algorithmic decision making, and openness by creating data lakes and data trusts) support the development of AI technology in society. The analysis shows that three cultural values are upheld and influence Nordic national AI strategies, while themes of privacy, ethics, and autonomy are present, and democracy, a societal building block in the Nordics, is especially prominent in the policies. For policy development, policy leaders must understand that without citizen involvement in AI implementation or lacking citizen AI education, we risk alienating those for who these services are meant to utilize and improve access for. © 2020 The AuthorAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence policy;  Cultural values;  Digital trust;  Openness;  Technology policy;  TransparencyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusLi, Y.57211569698;Exploration of computer-based ideological and political education mode in the new direction of science, technology and social development(2020) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1648 (3), art. no. 32186, .

In this study, we propose a Natural Language Processing based approach to generate Fill In The Blank English learning exercises. First, we classify the nature of the problem, and second, we look into the generation of learning exercises. We limited the scope of this research to verb conjugation exercises but it can be extended to other types of learning exercises as well. We looked into the generation of English learning exercises as two types of problems, a sequence labeling problem where we label each token from a sentence whether it could be a potential blank or not and as a sequence to sequence generation problem where we measure its effectiveness in generating such English learning exercises. Generation of FITB for English grammar through these approaches can be useful in the field of Education and can act as a baseline for future work on this problem. © 2020 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in Education;  Fill in the Blank generation;  Natural Language Processing;  Sequence Labeling;  Sequence to Sequence LearningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHu, S., Chew, E.57221911829;23989981600;The Investigation and Novel Trinity Modeling for Museum Robots(2020) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, art. no. 3436541, pp. 21-28.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100534692&doi=10.1145%2f3434780.3436541&partnerID=40&md5=d3590eeb339914c5ae54452913f6c309DOI: 10.1145/3434780.3436541ABSTRACT: There have been interactive museum tour-guide robots under investigation since the end of twentieth century.

This is predicted to force a major proportion of the workforce to re-educate itself during the next few decades. Consequently, this has led to a growing demand for multidisciplinary AI education also for students outside computer science. Therefore, a 25 credit (ECTS) cross-disciplinary study module on AI, targeting students in all faculties, was designed. We present findings from the design and implementation of the study module as well as students' initial perceptions towards AI at the beginning of the study module. Enrollment for the first implementation of the study module began in autumn 2019. The student distribution (N=144) between faculties was the following: natural sciences (n=37), social sciences (n=23), law (n=17), education (n=17), economics (n=16), medicine (n=10), humanities (n=10) and open university (n=14). Based on a survey distributed to students (N=34), the primary reason for enrolling to study AI was interest towards the subject, followed by the need of AI skills at work and relevance of AI in society. © 2020 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Cross-disciplinary;  education;  multidisciplinary;  study moduleDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSharef, N.M., Azmi Murad, M.A., Mansor, E.I., Nasharuddin, N.A., Omar, M.K., Samian, N., Arshad, N.I., Ismail, W., Shahbodin, F.35749213900;57210313353;23985650800;24464094700;57201472978;24725361100;25824626100;36133168800;24831356600;Learning-Analytics based Intelligent Simulator for Personalised Learning(2020) 2020 International Conference on Advancement in Data Science, E-Learning and Information Systems, ICADEIS 2020, art. no. 9276858, .

Instructors require information that could facilitate them in adapting their pedagogy design so the learning delivery could be optimized. However, existing solutions are limited to descriptive analytic and intervention facilitation is confined to students at risk prediction based on their course engagement frequency. Tools to predict final grade is available but very scarce. Besides, realtime monitoring of reaction to learning events are not available. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution that integrates Internet of Things, learning analytic and chatbot to fill the said gaps.

In a recent survey, dermatologists were overall positive toward a development with an increased use of AI, but little is known about the corresponding attitudes among pathologists working with dermatopathology. The objective of this investigation was to make an inventory of these attitudes. Participants and Methods: An anonymous and voluntary online survey was prepared and distributed to pathologists who regularly analyzed dermatopathology slides/images. The survey consisted of 39 question divided in five sections; (1) AI as a topic in pathology; (2) previous exposure to AI as a topic in general; (3) applications for AI in dermatopathology; (4) feelings and attitudes toward AI and (5) self-reported tech-savviness and demographics. The survey opened on March 13, 2020 and closed on May 5, 2020. Results: Overall, 718 responders (64.1% females) representing 91 countries were analyzed. While 81.5% of responders were aware of AI as an emerging topic in pathology, only 18.8% had either good or excellent knowledge about AI. In terms of diagnosis classification, 42.6% saw strong or very strong potential for automated suggestion of skin tumor diagnoses. The corresponding figure for inflammatory skin diseases was 23.0% (Padj &lt; 0.0001). For specific applications, the highest potential was considered for automated detection of mitosis (79.2%), automated suggestion of tumor margins (62.1%) and immunostaining evaluation (62.7%). The potential for automated suggestion of immunostaining (37.6%) and genetic panels (48.3%) were lower. Age did not impact the overall attitudes toward AI. Only 6.0% of the responders agreed or strongly agreed that the human pathologist will be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future. For the entire group, 72.3% agreed or strongly agreed that AI will improve dermatopathology and 84.1% thought that AI should be a part of medical training. Conclusions: Pathologists are generally optimistic about the impact and potential benefit of AI in dermatopathology. The highest potential is expected for narrow specified tasks rather than a global automated suggestion of diagnoses. There is a strong need for education about AI and its use within dermatopathology. © Copyright © 2020 Polesie, McKee, Gardner, Gillstedt, Siarov, Neittaanmäki and Paoli.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  attitude;  dermatopathology;  machine learning;  online surveyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusFukushima, Y., Shin, M., Miyazaki, K., Ito, T., Yonekura, R., Tanaka, M.S.57221519245;57189304179;57189309776;57189307517;57221534964;57191908735;Report Search Function Using TF-IDF for PBL Education(2020) 2020 IEEE 9th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics, GCCE 2020, art. no. 9291712, pp. 802-803.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099359017&doi=10.1109%2fGCCE50665.2020.9291712&partnerID=40&md5=adcc792cfe47f247f09f6d38f14c846eDOI: 10.1109/GCCE50665.2020.9291712ABSTRACT: The 21st century works need both 'hard' skills (traditional domains, such as, history, mathematics, science) as well as 'soft' skills (teamwork, disciplined thinking, creativity, social skills, computer literacy and analyze information). KIT and ICT have committed to on-line PBL education to educate students on the skills they need. Accurately grasping the learning situation of each student and promoting his growth by giving appropriate advice is effective for student's growth, and AI can be utilized to achieve this.

To keep up with this need, farmers and future farmers need to be trained in the ways of precision agriculture. With the widespread use of artificial intelligence across all industries, it is not surprising to find AI at the heart of precision agriculture. While AI has brought a lot of promise, it has also brought a lot of dread, due to the lack of understanding about what it is and what it can do. To help farmers buy into applying AI, a new educational program is needed. To this end, we have developed a simple active learning system to illustrate AI, particularly, machine learning. We present an overview of the system and discuss how it can contribute to future farmers' understanding of how AI works. © 2020 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: active learning;  artificial intelligence educationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHou, Y.57222580061;Discussion on Practice and Promotion Strategy of College Music Education Informatization Based on Artificial Intelligence(2020) Proceedings - 2020 International Conference on Computers, Information Processing and Advanced Education, CIPAE 2020, art. no. 9373676, pp. 114-116.

The purpose of this article is to promote the in-depth integration of college music and information education by discussing the informationization of college ME under AI. In this paper, we conducted a questionnaire survey on students from several major universities in City A to understand the current status of the informationization of ME in universities, and randomly selected some students for interviews. It is concluded that 88.1% of the students surveyed believe that the combination of informatization and ME has enriched music resources; 73.81% of the students surveyed believed that education informatization promoted communication between teachers and students and broadened their academic horizons. The research in this article is helpful to the application of informatization of ME in colleges and universities (CAU), and promotes the equity of ME resources in CAU, thereby promoting the innovative development of ME. © 2020 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  college music;  education informatization;  promotion strategiesDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYu, Z.35975507500;Visualizing artificial intelligence used in education over two decades(2020) Journal of Information Technology Research, 13 (4), pp. 32-46.

While teaching, insofar as it involves training human minds, is still mostly a form of art rather than a regular science, the taking up of this elitist job by computers has triggered much debate and controversy, involving the teaching community as much as the select corporate AI giants who strive to create computers capable of teaching better than humans. This paper surveys the most relevant studies carried out in this field to date. First, it introduces AI and describes the different AI applications in field of education and course assessment. It then goes on to list the most common topics in the educational context that have been resolved through AI and machine learning techniques, and finally, some of the most promising future lines of research are discussed. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Even though the use of AI to education is not new, it has not unleashed its full potential yet. Much of the available research looks at educational robotics and at non-intelligent robots in education. Only recently, research has sought to assess the potential of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), including humanoids, within the domain of classroom learning, particularly in relation to learning languages. Yet, the use of this form of AI in the field of mathematics and science constitutes a notable gap in this field. This study aims to critically review the research on the use of SARs in the pre-tertiary classroom teaching of mathematics and science. Further aim is to identify the benefits and disadvantages of such technology. Databases' search conducted between January and April 2018 yielded twenty-one studies meeting the set inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Findings were grouped into four major categories synthesising current evidence of the contribution of SARs in pre-tertiary education: learning gain, user experience, attitude, and usability of SARs within classroom settings. Overall, the use of SARs in pre-tertiary education is promising, but studies focussing on mathematics and science are significantly under-represented. Further evidence is also required around SARs' specific contributions to learning more broadly, as well as enabling/impeding factors, such as SAR's personalisation and appearance, or the role of families and ethical considerations. Finally, SARs potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity of multi-cultural pre-tertiary classroom is almost unexplored. © 2020 Elsevier LtdAUTHOR KEYWORDS: Early years education;  Elementary education;  Improving classroom teaching;  Secondary education;  Socially assistive robotsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusIchien, N., Lu, H., Holyoak, K.J.56625994600;7404843551;7003743200;Verbal analogy problem sets: An inventory of testing materials(2020) Behavior Research Methods, 52 (5), pp. 1803-1816.

It provides applications in addition to the traditional computing environments, and is also in affordable smart devices, making AI available everywhere. These affordable devices have built-in capabilities to handle complex computing tasks (edge computing), flexible access to fast network resources, access to cloud-based services to solve complex problems on a collaborative basis, and access to an enormous amount of open and closed data resources. In education, AI contributes in at least two ways: (1) the scope and content of education - what kind of education is needed; and (2) the process of education - support and changes to education and the teacher's work. In the scope of education, we must consider that AI (and related technologies) will replace some jobs (education will no longer be needed), some jobs will change dramatically (education content must be modified), and a lot of new jobs will be generated (new education must be established). In the process of education - the work itself - AI will have and has the role of reformer and enabler, which also changes the characteristics and division of duties. In this paper we analyze the opportunities and challenges caused by AI in education. Although the focus is on the role of AI, it is difficult to separate it from other technology-driven changes, especially in the discussion about work life. © 2020 Croatian Society MIPRO.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Computers in Education;  Expert Systems;  Intelligent Systems;  Learning;  Machine Learning;  TeachingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYang, J., Gao, X., Zhao, W.38762342700;8694616600;57198598095;Towards systems education for artificial intelligence: A course practice in intelligent computing architectures(2020) Proceedings of the ACM Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI, GLSVLSI, pp. 567-572.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091269070&doi=10.1145%2f3386263.3406935&partnerID=40&md5=aff50fc846adddb0b36f73a0d220d968DOI: 10.1145/3386263.3406935ABSTRACT: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) community, education in AI is receiving more and more attentions. There have been many AI related courses in the respects of algorithms and applications, while not many courses in system level are seriously taken into considerations. In order to bridge the gap between AI and computing systems, we are trying to explore how to conduct AI education from the perspective of computing systems. In this paper, a course practice in intelligent computing architectures are provided to demonstrate the system education in AI era. The motivation for this course practice is first introduced as well as the learning orientations. The main goal of this course aims to teach students for designing AI accelerators on FPGA platforms. The elaborated course contents include lecture notes and related technical materials. Especially several practical labs and projects are detailed illustrated.

StarCraft: Brood War (SC:BW) is one of such games. Recently, a new large, unlabeled human versus human SC:BW game replay dataset called STARDATA was published. This paper aims to prove that the player strategy diversity requirement of the dataset is met, i.e., that the diversity of player strategies in STARDATA replays is of sufficient quality. To this end, we built a competitive SC:BW agent from scratch and trained its strategic decision making process on STARDATA. The results show that in the current state of the competitive environment the agent is capable of keeping a stable rating and a decent win rate over a longer period of time. It also performs better than our other, simple rule-based agent. Therefore, we conclude that the strategy diversity requirement of STARDATA is met. © 2020 Polish Information Processing Society - as it is since 2011.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusLi, H., Chen, B., Li, J., Liu, W., Ren, T., Zheng, S., Xue, W., Liu, A., Luo, Z., Wen, J., Jin, T.36065538000;57219283615;56003087700;57219284822;57219279924;24777770100;57219281241;57219284011;57196083854;12766417000;57219285617;Status, problems and countermeasures of artificial intelligence application in medical education [医学教育中人工智能应用的现状、问题与对策](2020) Chinese Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine, 20 (9), pp. 1092-1097.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092036951&doi=10.7507%2f1672-2531.201910092&partnerID=40&md5=55f440bfec4b803f281f57863d618feeDOI: 10.7507/1672-2531.201910092ABSTRACT: Human society has entered the age of artificial intelligence(AI).

Technology-related factors encompass functionality, helpfulness, interpretability, dependability and interaction interface. Context-related factors encompass benevolence of educational organizations, data management, teachers’ competencies, official norms and knowledge characteristics. Individual-related factors encompass perception of the nature of learning, propensity to interact with teachers, perception of AI and autonomy orientation.

One of the most innovative approaches in this field is the use of data and machine learning for the detection of a student’s affective state, to move them out of negative states that inhibit learning, into positive states such as engagement. In spite of their obvious potential to provide the personalisation that would give extra support for learners with intellectual disabilities, little work on AIEd systems that utilise affect recognition currently addresses this group. Our system used multimodal sensor data and machine learning to first identify three affective states linked to learning (engagement, frustration, boredom) and second determine the presentation of learning content so that the learner is maintained in an optimal affective state and rate of learning is maximised. To evaluate this adaptive learning system, 67 participants aged between 6 and 18 years acting as their own control took part in a series of sessions using the system. Sessions alternated between using the system with both affect detection and learning achievement to drive the selection of learning content (intervention) and using learning achievement alone (control) to drive the selection of learning content. Lack of boredom was the state with the strongest link to achievement, with both frustration and engagement positively related to achievement. There was significantly more engagement and less boredom in intervention than control sessions, but no significant difference in achievement. These results suggest that engagement does increase when activities are tailored to the personal needs and emotional state of the learner and that the system was promoting affective states that in turn promote learning. However, longer exposure is necessary to determine the effect on learning. © 2020 The Authors.

Intelligent tutoring systems, a major application of artificial intelligence in education, have drawn extensive concerns. However, in reality, the penetration rate of intelligent tutoring systems and the enthusiasm of faculty to use are still relatively low. This research examined the determinants of the willingness of faculty to use intelligent tutoring systems. Innovation diffusion theory was the theoretical basis of this research and it was adapted by incorporating perceived trust and experience. To gather data, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was performed and structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. The findings indicated that relative advantage, compatibility, perceived trust and experience are the contributing determinants of the willingness of faculty to use intelligent tutoring systems, while complexity has no significant effect. Meanwhile, complexity is significantly negatively affected by experience and compatibility. Relative advantage is significantly positively affected by perceived trust but not by complexity. Based on the research findings, relevant recommendations for encouraging faculty to use intelligent tutoring systems were proposed. © 2020 British Educational Research AssociationAUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  experience;  innovation diffusion theory;  intelligent tutoring systems;  perceived trust;  willingness to useDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusFu, S., Gu, H., Yang, B.56727235600;57684045000;55535516000;The affordances of AI-enabled automatic scoring applications on learners’ continuous learning intention: An empirical study in China(2020) British Journal of Educational Technology, 51 (5), pp. 1674-1692.

One typical application of AI in digital language education is the automatic scoring application that provides feedback on pronunciation repeat outcomes. This research is motivated by the usage of automatic scoring-empowered digital learning tools by language learners, and set out to uncover the influencing mechanisms of AI-enabled automatic scoring application affordances on learners’ continuous learning intention. Specifically, based on affordance theory, we found several automatic scoring application affordances through in-depth interviews. Considering the current lack of investigations on the mechanisms underlying automatic scoring application and its implications for learners’ learning behaviors, we built a model to examine the role of automatic scoring application affordances on cognitive/emotional engagement and following continuous learning intention. We further examined the moderation role of in-job learners and student learners on the above relationships. The model was tested using a survey of 260 Chinese foreign language learners who used AI-empowered learning tools to facilitate their language learning practices. This study explores why learners continuously use AI-enabled automatic scoring applications by identifying the affordances that differentiate it from traditional educational technologies. Practitioners could take the identified affordances into account when designing AI-enabled language learning applications. © 2020 British Educational Research AssociationAUTHOR KEYWORDS: affordance;  artificial intelligence;  continuous learning intention;  engagementDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusLiu, Z., Yang, S., Tang, J., Heffernan, N., Luckin, R.56101750800;36471600600;56245477300;14041775100;35608174500;Recent Advances in Multimodal Educational Data Mining in K-12 Education(2020) Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 3549-3550.

The physics subject in secondary school has already been revised from the 2009 National Curriculum so that this IT-based modern science and technology can be meaningfully fused in line with the development of modern physics. However, foundations for such convergent education in teacher education or re-education in schools, are still insufficient. In this study, an IT convergence-based physics education training course developed for teacher re-education was conducted, and based on the results, the teacher's perception on how IT convergence-based physics education is applicable was investigated. The results are reported based on the positive and the negative responses from teachers. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: 4th Industrial Revolution;  Arduino;  Education;  IT-basedDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusTian, J.55244119100;The Human Resources Development Applications of Machine Learning in the View of Artificial Intelligence(2020) 2020 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering Technology, CCET 2020, art. no. 9213113, pp. 39-43.

The designed survey questionnaire was administrated in a school district in Beijing after an AI course was developed and implemented. The collected data and analytical results provided insights regarding the self-reported perceptions of primary students' AI readiness and enabled the identification of factors that may influence this parameter. The results indicated that AI literacy was not predictive of AI readiness. The influences of AI literacy were mediated by the students' confidence and perception of AI relevance. The students' AI readiness was not influenced by a reduction in their anxiety regarding AI and an enhancement in their AI literacy. Male students reported a higher confidence, relevance, and readiness for AI than female students did. The sentiments reflected by the open-ended responses of the students indicated that the students were generally excited to learn about AI and viewed AI as a powerful and useful technology. The student sentiments confirmed the quantitative findings. The validated survey can help teachers better understand and monitor students' learning, as well as reflect on the design of the AI curriculum and the associated teaching effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI anxiety;  AI education;  AI literacy;  Student readiness for AI;  Student surveyDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusBurger-Stritt, S., Eff, A., Quinkler, M., Kienitz, T., Stamm, B., Willenberg, H.S., Meyer, G., Klein, J., Reisch, N., Droste, M., Hahner, S.55808210500;57217336777;16040157900;55055266200;57212313300;7003599708;7402851088;57217336723;15052590100;23979810900;57194645593;Standardised patient education in adrenal insufficiency: a prospective multi-centre evaluation(2020) European Journal of Endocrinology, 183 (2), pp. 119-127.

Patient education is regarded an important measure for prevention of AC and improvement of AI management. A standardized education programme was elaborated for patients with chronic AI in Germany. Design: Longitudinal, prospective, questionnaire-based, multi-centre study. Methods: During 2-h sessions, patients (n = 526) were provided with basic knowledge on AI, equipped with emergency cards and sets and trained in self-injection of hydrocortisone. To evaluate the education programme, patients from eight certified centres completed questionnaires before, immediately after and 6–9 months after training. Results: 399 completed data sets were available for analysis. Questionnaire score-values were significantly higher after patient education, indicating successful knowledge transfer (baseline: 17 ± 7.1 of a maximum score of 29; after training: 23 ± 4.2; P < 0.001), and remained stable over 6–9 months. Female sex, younger age and primary cause of AI were associated with higher baseline scores; after education, age, cause of AI and previous adrenal crisis had a significant main effect on scores. 91% of patients would dare performing self-injection after training, compared to 68% at baseline. An improvement of subjective well-being through participation in the education programme was indicated by 95% of the patients 6–9 months after participation. Conclusion: Patient group education in chronic AI represents a helpful tool for the guidance of patients, their self-assurance and their knowledge on prevention of adrenal crises. Repeated training and adaptation to specific needs, for example, of older patients is needed. © 2020 European Society of Endocrinology Printed in Great BritainDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusBrega, A.G., Jiang, L., Johnson, R.L., Wilson, A.R., Schmiege, S.J., Albino, J.8685843000;57210965555;57209504063;56420120500;55973272100;7004192003;Health Literacy and Parental Oral Health Knowledge, Beliefs, Behavior, and Status Among Parents of American Indian Newborns(2020) Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, 7 (4), pp. 598-608.

Methods: This analysis used baseline data from a randomized controlled trial that tested an oral health intervention with parents of AI newborns. Participants were recruited in parent-child dyads (N = 579). Parents completed items assessing sociodemographic characteristics, HL, and parental oral health knowledge, beliefs, behavior, and self-reported OHS. We examined the correlation of HL with each oral health construct, controlling for parent age and income. Results: On average, parents felt quite confident in their HL skills, performed well on questions assessing parental oral health knowledge, and endorsed beliefs likely to encourage positive parental oral health behaviors (e.g., confidence that one can successfully engage in such behaviors). Parents with more limited HL had significantly less knowledge, perceived cavities to be less severe, perceived more barriers and fewer benefits to recommended oral health behaviors, were less confident they could engage in these behaviors, and were more likely to believe their children’s oral health was under the control of the dentist or a matter of chance (P values < 0.001). Limited HL was not associated with behavior (P > 0.05) but was linked to worse self-reported OHS (P = 0.040). Conclusions: HL was associated with parental oral health knowledge, beliefs, and self-reported OHS. Oral health education interventions targeting AI families should facilitate development of knowledge and positive oral health beliefs among parents with more limited HL skills. © 2019, W.

While media and policy discourse often portray China’s AI development in terms of a unified national strategy, and a burgeoning geopolitical contestation for future global dominance, this analysis will suggest a more nuanced internal complexity, involving differing regional networks and international corporate activity. The first section considers two key policy documents published by the central Chinese government, which are shown to implicate educational institutions as influential actors in national and regional strategies for AI development, with a significant role in plans to train domestic expertise. The second section outlines three prominent private education companies: New Oriental Group, Tomorrow Advancing Life (TAL), and Squirrel AI.

Focusing on facial coding emotional AI that uses computer vision and algorithms to see, recognise, categorise and learn about facial expressions of emotion, this paper evaluates nascent usage of these technologies in education. To do this, it assesses the nature of child rights, the history and modern usage of face-based emotional AI, methodology and efficacy, and what this paper sees as a clash of private and public interests. Concern is shown to be two-fold: first is on method, especially given scope for material effects on students; second are ethical and legal concerns. While proposing a list of considerations for any implementation for these technologies in the classroom, the paper concludes that significant risks exist in deployment of these technologies in the classroom. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Affective computing;  creepiness;  EdTech;  emotional AI;  human rightsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusPerrotta, C., Selwyn, N.51161795400;55882979400;Deep learning goes to school: toward a relational understanding of AI in education(2020) Learning, Media and Technology, 45 (3), pp. 251-269.

In this article, we question the applicability of these methods to education. In particular, we consider a case of recent attempts from data scientists to add AI elements to a handful of online learning environments, such as Khan Academy and the ASSISTments intelligent tutoring system. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS), we provide a detailed examination of the scholarly work carried out by several data scientists around the use of ‘deep learning’ to predict aspects of educational performance. This approach draws attention to relations between various (problematic) units of analysis: flawed data, partially incomprehensible computational methods, narrow forms of educational’ knowledge baked into the online environments, and a reductionist discourse of data science with evident economic ramifications. These relations can be framed ethnographically as a ‘controversy’ that casts doubts on AI as an objective scientific endeavour, whilst illuminating the confusions, the disagreements and the economic interests that surround its implementations. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  algorithm studies;  deep learning;  educational platforms;  Machine learning;  relational analysisDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusCantero, C.L., Oviedo, G.B., Barboza, W.F., Feria, M.V.57223334444;57223347113;57223347506;57223334711;Emerging technologies in the teaching-learning process: Towards the critical thinking development [Tecnologías emergentes en el proceso de enseñanza-aprendizaje: Hacia el desarrollo del pensamiento crítico](2020) Revista Electronica Interuniversitaria de Formacion del Profesorado, 23 (3), pp. 83-98.

It assesses whether there is a difference in the perceptions of risk and trust in artificial intelligence expressed by the general public compared with those studying computer science in higher education. We define the general public as people having no specific level or specialist knowledge of AI yet with a high stake as potential users of AI systems on a regular basis with or without their knowledge. In the study, participants engaged in an AI debate on topical news articles at a public national science museum event and a University in the UK and completed a questionnaire with two sections: their assessment of trust and risk of an AI application based on a topical news story, and a set of general opinion questions on AI. Results indicate that in specific applications there is a significant difference of opinion between the two groups with regards to risk. Both groups strongly agreed that education in how AI works was significant in building trust. © 2020 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: perception;  risk;  trustDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusCao, Z.57201502429;Input-to-state stability for hybrid delayed systems with delay-dependent impulses(2020) Chinese Control Conference, CCC, 2020-July, art. no. 9189624, pp. 43-47.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091395777&doi=10.23919%2fCCC50068.2020.9189624&partnerID=40&md5=4c2f917b11a25b2365baefe6724f4cbbDOI: 10.23919/CCC50068.2020.9189624ABSTRACT: This paper considers the input-to-state stability (ISS) problem for a class of hybrid time-delay systems with delay-dependent impulses by employing admissible impulsive edge-dependent average dwell time (AIED-ADT) switching.

The implications are especially strong for privacy, as ML approaches provide unprecedented opportunities to make use of collected data. Thus, education on cybersecurity and AI is needed. To investigate how AI and cybersecurity should be taught together, we look at previous studies on cybersecurity MOOCs by conducting a systematic literature review. The initial search resulted in 72 items and after screening for only peer-reviewed publications on cybersecurity online courses, 15 studies remained. Three of the studies concerned multiple cybersecurity MOOCs whereas 12 focused on individual courses. The number of published work evaluating specific cybersecurity MOOCs was found to be small compared to all available cybersecurity MOOCs. Analysis of the studies revealed that cybersecurity education is, in almost all cases, organised based on the topic instead of used tools, making it difficult for learners to find focused information on AI applications in cybersecurity. Furthermore, there is a gab in academic literature on how AI applications in cybersecurity should be taught in online courses. © 2020 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Cybersecurity;  Machine learning;  mOOC;  Systematic literature reviewDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusParanjape, K., Schinkel, M., Nanayakkara, P.14834107700;57211339218;6602716288;Short Keynote Paper: Mainstreaming Personalized Healthcare-Transforming Healthcare through New Era of Artificial Intelligence(2020) IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 24 (7), art. no. 8988253, pp. 1860-1863.

A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which “learns” intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce. © The Author(s) 2020.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: decision-making;  deep learning;  dental;  diagnostic systems;  informatics;  machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusVodenko, K.V., Lyausheva, S.A.56669747300;56646605500;Science and education in the form 4.0: public policy and organization based on human and artificial intellectual capital(2020) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 21 (4), pp. 549-564.

Design/methodology/approach: The methods of regression and correlation analysis are used. The role of human and artificial intellectual capital for provision of effectiveness and competitiveness of the system of science and education is determined, as well as its correspondence to the modern challenges. Analysis of perspectives and limitations of automatization of the system of science and education based on AI is conducted; a model of organization of the system of science and education in the form 4.0 based on human and artificial intellectual capital is compiled. Findings: It is established that in the system of science and education, the decisive production factor is intellectual capital, but human intellect does not necessarily have to dominate in its structure. AI is one of the most popular technologies of Industry 4.0 in the system of science and education, which has wide perspectives of practical implementation. As experience of the leading world universities, which had the highest level of digitization in 2018, showed, foundation on non-breakthrough digital technologies (computer equipment and Internet) does not allow opening the potential of increase of indicators of effectiveness and competitiveness of the system of science and education and bringing it in correspondence to the modern challenges based on digitization. However, correlation of activity of application of artificial intellectual capital with these indicators is four times higher (0.2), as compared to correlation of these indicators with activity of application of human intellectual capital (0.05). This shows demand for digitization of the system of science and education, but based on breakthrough digital technologies, of which AI should become the key one. Originality/value: It is substantiated that higher education could be automatized based on AI by 85% and science by 63%. Therefore, on the whole in the system of science and education, the share of AI in the structure of intellectual capital could reach 74% ((85 + 63)/2). It is recommended to use the developed model of organization of the system of science and education in the form 4.0 based on human and artificial intellectual capital. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Automatization;  Education;  Human intellect;  Industry 4.0;  Intellectual capital;  Organization;  Public policy;  Science;  University in the form 4.0DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusTucker, C., Jackson, K.S., Park, J.J.15833577900;54894800700;57193906520;Exploring the future of engineering education: Perspectives from a workshop on artificial intelligence and the future of stem and societies(2020) ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings, 2020-June, art. no. 691, .

To best address these issues, engineering researchers, policy advocates, and industry leaders were convened to discuss the future of STEM and societies in the age of AI. From an engineering education domain, workshop participants were made aware of fundamental breakthroughs in AI that have resulted in their wide-scale adoption in society, and how these breakthroughs may impact the types of jobs that engineers of the future will do. Pre- and post-survey data were acquired from the participants in order to quantify the differences, if any, in terminology such as AI, and STEM. Beyond semantic differences in terminology, data pertaining to the solutions proposed by different groups were also collected. I.e., from an academic point of view, what changes are needed in industry and government, in order to facilitate the changing nature of education? From a government perspective, what should be the national funding priorities in order to ensure that the U.S. remains highly competitive on the global landscape and leverages the power of AI to innovate and retrain its workforce? From an industry perspective, how should degree programs evolve to meet the needs of the real world? Findings from this workshop can serve as a guide to researchers and decision makers in academia, government and industry on how AI will transform both STEM education and the workforce. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusYuan, S.57217590297;Application and Study of Musical Artificial Intelligence in Music Education Field(2020) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1533 (3), art. no. 032033, .

According to TalentSeer's '2020 AI Talent Report', the demand for AI (artificial intelligence) talent has increased by 74% annually in 2016-2019, with a talent gap of up to one million. Universities are the core force to build the world AI innovation center. It is the current direction of university talent training reform to integrate the idea of innovation and entrepreneurship education into the AI talent training program and cultivate innovative talents in the realm of AI to gratify social and industrial demands. To this end, we have made a detailed discussion on the cultivation of artificial intelligence talents' practical ability from the aspects of establishing open source thinking development innovation practice project, relying on discipline competition to increase undergraduate innovative and entrepreneurial capabilities, designing a multi-disciplinary practice teaching model, and constructing innovative and entrepreneurial practice platforms to meet industrial requirements. © 2020 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence talent;  Entrepreneurship;  Innovation;  Practice teachingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHan, X., Zou, J., Ren, W., Sun, Y.57218584834;35319185500;57201875550;56358931400;A Game Battle Platform based on Web-API for Artificial Intelligence Education(2020) 2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, IWCMC 2020, art. no. 9148114, pp. 1789-1793.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089705336&doi=10.1109%2fIWCMC48107.2020.9148114&partnerID=40&md5=c06acdc6f68472b184cf563c43772465DOI: 10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148114ABSTRACT: The potential for computer games as a tool for AI research and education continues to blossom. The game battle platform provides a place for students to learn artificial intelligence theory and practice artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the existing platforms perform poorly in terms of possessing high concurrency, debugging bot and supporting Scratch language. In order to resolve these problems, this paper first presents a web-API battle mechanism using Websocket protocol. It increases the number of concurrent matches on servers. Next, we give an offline battle tool to make it easier to debug and test bots for users. In addition, the special environment is introduced to support programming bots in Scratch. Finally, we conduct the comparison experiment between the proposed mechanism and traditional battle methods.

Therefore, recognizing and understanding these states in the context of learning is key in designing informed interventions and addressing the needs of the individual student to provide personalized education. In this paper, we explore the automatic detection of learner’s nonverbal behaviors involving hand-over-face gestures, head and eye movements and emotions via facial expressions during learning. The proposed computer vision-based behavior monitoring method uses a low-cost webcam and can easily be integrated with modern tutoring technologies. We investigate these behaviors in-depth over time in a classroom session of 40 minutes involving reading and problem-solving exercises. The exercises in the sessions are divided into three categories: an easy, medium and difficult topic within the context of undergraduate computer science. We found that there is a significant increase in head and eye movements as time progresses, as well as with the increase of difficulty level. We demonstrated that there is a considerable occurrence of hand-over-face gestures (on average 21.35%) during the 40 minutes session and is unexplored in the education domain. We propose a novel deep learning approach for automatic detection of hand-over-face gestures in images with a classification accuracy of 86.87%. There is a prominent increase in hand-over-face gestures when the difficulty level of the given exercise increases. The hand-over-face gestures occur more frequently during problem-solving (easy 23.79%, medium 19.84% and difficult 30.46%) exercises in comparison to reading (easy 16.20%, medium 20.06% and difficult 20.18%). © 2020, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive and intelligent multimedia and hypermedia systems;  Computer-supported collaborative learning;  Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs);  Neural models applied to AIED systemsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusCukurova, M., Luckin, R., Kent, C.56904209900;35608174500;35782011800;Impact of an Artificial Intelligence Research Frame on the Perceived Credibility of Educational Research Evidence(2020) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 30 (2), pp. 205-235.

In the literature, there is evidence that people overweight research evidence when framed in neuroscience findings. In this paper, we present the findings of the first investigation of the impact of an AI frame on the perceived credibility of educational research evidence. In an experimental study, we allocated 605 participants including educators to one of three conditions in which the same educational research evidence was framed within one of: AI, neuroscience, or educational psychology. The results demonstrate that when educational research evidence is framed within AI research, it is considered as less credible in comparison to when it is framed instead within neuroscience or educational psychology. The effect is still evident when the subjects’ familiarity with the framing discipline is controlled for. Furthermore, our results indicate that the general public perceives AI to be: less helpful in assisting us to understand how children learn, lacking in adherence to scientific methods, and to be less prestigious compared to neuroscience and educational psychology. Considering the increased use of AI technologies in Educational settings, we argue that there should be significant attempts to recover the public image of AI being less scientifically robust and less prestigious than educational psychology and neuroscience. We conclude the article suggesting that AI in Education community should attempt to be more actively engaged with key stakeholders of AI and Education to help mitigate such effects. © 2019, The Author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in Education;  Perceived credibility;  Research evidence;  The in-credible AI effectDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusChen, X.57217584720;AI + Education: Self-adaptive Learning Promotes Individualized Educational Revolutionary(2020) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 44-47.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087418834&doi=10.1145%2f3399971.3399984&partnerID=40&md5=6f29379b6657d9b5a07df4e673bd2e60DOI: 10.1145/3399971.3399984ABSTRACT: Recently, AI technology has implemented speedily in the applications of education, the all academia embraces that the Bonus period has already came.

Objective: To inform cultural adaptation of a validated evidence-based intervention (VEBI) originally designed to deliver preconception counseling and diabetes education to non-AI/AN teens with diabetes. Design: Qualitative data were collected using focus group and individual interview methods with health care professionals and experts (n = 16) in AI/AN health, GDM, adolescent health, and/or mother-daughter communication. A semistructured discussion guide elicited responses about provision of care for AI/AN girls at risk for GDM, experience with successful programs for AI/AN teens, comfort of mother/daughter dyads in talking about diabetes and reproductive health and reactions to video clips and booklet selections from the VEBI. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data analysis included inductive coding and identification of emergent themes. Results: Providers felt teens and their moms would be comfortable talking about the VEBI topics and that teens who did not feel comfortable talking to their mom would likely rely on another adult female. Participants suggested including: AI/AN images/motifs, education with a community focus, and avoiding directive language. Concerns included: socioeconomic issues that affect AI/AN people such as: food and housing insecurity, abuse, and historical trauma. Conclusions: Perspectives from these participants have been used to guide the development of a culturally tailored GDM risk reduction program for AI/AN girls. This program will be available to health care providers who serve the AI/AN population. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In the broad domain of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) the necessity is even more so due to proliferation and appropriation of terms from other fields and public discourse - the term 'smart' is a classic example; as is 'deep learning'. In reviewing the emerging impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the field of Information Technology for Learning, Education, and Training (ITLET), this paper highlights several questions that might assist in developing scope statements of new work items. While learners and teachers are very much foregrounded in past and present standardization efforts in ITLET, little attention has been placed until recently on whether these learners and teachers are necessarily human. Now that AI is a hot spot of innovation it is receiving considerable attention from standardization bodies such as ISO/IEC, IEEE and pan-European initiatives such as the Next Generation Internet. Thus, terminology such as 'blended learning' necessarily now spans not just humans in a mix of online and offline learning, but also mixed reality and AI paradigms, developed to assist human learners in environments such as Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS) that extend the scope and design of a learning experience where a symbiosis is formed between humans and AI. Although the fields of LET and AI may utilize similar terms, the language of AI is mathematics and terms can mean different things in each field. Nonetheless, in 'symbiotic learning' contexts where an AIS at times replaces a human teacher, a symbiosis between the human learner and the AIS occurs in such a way where both can exist as teacher and learner. While human ethics and values are preeminent in this new symbiosis, a shift towards a new 'intelligence nexus' is signalled where ethics and values can also apply to AI in learning, education, and training (LET) contexts. In making sense of the scope of standardization efforts in the context of LET based AI, issues for the human-computer interface become more complex than simply appropriating terminology such as 'smart' in the next era of standardization. Framed by ITLET perspectives, this paper focuses on detailing the implications for standardization and key questions arising from developments in Artificial Intelligence. At a high level, we need to ask: do the scopes of current LET related Standards Committees still apply and if not, what scope changes are needed?. © 2020 the Author(s).

There is a need for additional HCI research investigating a) what competencies users need in order to effectively interact with and critically evaluate AI and b) how to design learner-centered AI technologies that foster increased user understanding of AI. This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature. This paper's contributions can be used to start a conversation about and guide future research on AI literacy within the HCI community. © 2020 ACM.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  AI for K-12;  AI literacy;  artificial intelligence;  computing education;  machine learningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusCheng, Y., Ma, S., Chen, J., Zhao, Y., Chen, Y., Wang, J., Xing, J., Guo, W., Jing, Y., Wu, G., Zhu, W.57155447900;57218763882;57218771518;57218770831;57218770488;56962595200;57219209739;57218770228;12140493600;57219209198;57218766526;Towards Web-based Etymological Hanzi Learning(2020) The Web Conference 2020 - Companion of the World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2020, pp. 158-162.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091696598&doi=10.1145%2f3366424.3383531&partnerID=40&md5=91189fa277e7f1968027b0bdaa3d4b93DOI: 10.1145/3366424.3383531ABSTRACT: Modern-day Chinese characters, or Hanzi, originate from the ancient oracle-bone scripts (ç"2éæ ‡).

The central problems viewed from an artificial intelligence perspective shift slightly depending on whether one's main focus of interest in education is the teacher side of the role, the student side, or the educational interaction itself and the cognitive tools that support. One aspect of the issue of teaching versus learning crystallized into the issue of whether the educational system should attempt to model the student. The main shift of focus of artificial intelligence in education has been from learning considered simply as epistemology to learning as a psychological process operating under a number of constraints. The shift of emphasis from the "what" to the "how" of learning reflects an undermining of the idealization of the learner as some disembodied, entirely rational learning mechanism. A similar shift is evidenced by the willingness to acknowledge the affective dimension. © 2020 Taylor and Francis.

Educators using AIEd will have a meaningful impact on the teaching learning process. In the current scenario of education, there exists a gap between the knowledge gained by the students and teaching learning process. Also, the understanding levels of students vary from rapid learning by few students with very slow learning by few students.

This is represented in the cyber-physical context, in which humans and technologies are allowed to coexist and learn from each other. Design/methodology/approach: The logistics and supply chain sector consists of numerous partners and stakeholders, and despite the limited inclusion of automation and AI within the sector, there are still many manual and repetitive tasks. Findings: Stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain sector are creating awareness and slowly implementing AI and automation within their operations. The majority of shipping and logistics is done through the maritime sector, and this is expected to increase in line with the world’s population. Research limitations/implications: Research was limited to Jamaica and a few other countries in the Caribbean. Broadening the scope to include other regional shipping and logistics industry stakeholders would be helpful. Practical implications: The removal of sometimes mundane and even more complex manual processes in the logistics supply chain will give rise to more efficiencies and possibly increased revenue. Social implications: Creating awareness in the Caribbean of international trends is a challenge. Empowering people to use automation and AI for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change and other disasters is yet to be fully realized. However, those who took part in the study did show a significant inclination toward the use of automation and AI in their every-day lives. Originality/value: The purpose of this paper is to examine statistical data on the understanding of automation and AI within education, the port authority and major operators in the shipping and logistics sector throughout the Caribbean. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Automation;  Blue economy;  Caribbean;  Logistics;  ShippingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusBogosian, B., Bobadilla, L., Alonso, M., Elias, A., Perez, G., Alhaffar, H., Vassigh, S.57203502639;55574215481;57220821501;57193609294;57219023918;57193616742;57203133538;Work in Progress: Towards an Immersive Robotics Training for the Future of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Workforce(2020) EDUNINE 2020 - 4th IEEE World Engineering Education Conference: The Challenges of Education in Engineering, Computing and Technology without Exclusions: Innovation in the Era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, Proceedings, art. no. 9149493, .

However, it is also expected that these technologies will lead to job displacement, alter skill profiles for existing jobs, and change how people work. Therefore, preparing the workforce for an economy defined by these technologies is imperative. This ongoing research focuses on developing an immersive learning training curriculum to prepare the future workforce of the building industry. In this paper we are demonstrating a prototype of a mobile AR application to deliver lessons for training in robotic automation for construction industry workers. The application allows a user to interact with a virtual robot manipulator to learn its basic operations. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the AR application by gauging participants' performance using pre and post surveys. © 2020 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence in Education;  Augmented Reality;  Curriculum Design;  Education for AEC (Architecture;  Engineering and Construction);  Immersive Learning;  Robotics and AutomationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusJeong, G.H.14621467500;Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women's health nursing(2020) Korean Journal of Women Health Nursing, 26 (1), pp. 5-9.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers' ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women's nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women's age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice.

AI (especially machine learning, ML) has a chance to change the legal profession. With relation to the legal industry automation processes, it may be argued that the AI is currently replacing only specifi c tasks, not the entire profession. However, it is not certain for how long this thesis will remain valid. AI transforms the legal domain for the better. However, it does not necessarily mean that it will change for the better for every lawyer. In order to adjust the new generations of law students to the changing technological reality, it is necessary to consider modifi cations in legal education. The purpose of the paper is to outline these transformations and their possible consequences. © 2020 Editions Weblaw.

New discussions are conducted regarding what implications this has for the education of today's generation-and that of those in the decades to come. As artificial intelligence (AI) branching from computer science (CS) is becoming more ubiquitous and seamless behind the scene in our daily life, many countries have dedicated significant amounts of resources in order to fuel research to maximize their leverage of this continually developing technology. This renewed interest in AI has sparked discourse about the importance of AI knowledge, concepts, and computational skills for young people, and about the introduction of CS education in K-12. This article aims to reshape the concepts of AI through the lens of historical development in computing industry and education, and to uncover a new direction for AI education in K-12 around the globe. © 2020 ACMDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusFariani, R.I., Damayanti, A.57215539118;57215539290;Development of Accreditation Information System (AIS) for vocational higher education with NAAHE standard(2020) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1456 (1), art. no. 012019, .https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081112763&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1456%2f1%2f012019&partnerID=40&md5=cd34418fcf613a75761049e7b03c121bDOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1456/1/012019ABSTRACT: Higher Education Accreditation is an activity that must be implemented by every college for every 5 years where this activity becomes a benchmark for college sustainability. This accreditation must be in line with the National Accreditation Agency for Higher Education (NAAHE) standards. Astra Manufacturing Polytechnic (Polman Astra) as one of the vocational higher education also conducts the accreditation. In compiling the accreditation instrument Polman Astra has a problem such as the inaccuracy of accreditation data between one department and another and the difficulty of coordinating among departments in providing data accreditation compilation. This problem may cause the late of accreditation according to a predetermined time. Due to this problem, an information system was built, namely Accreditation Information System (AIS). It is a web-based information system and designed according to NAAHE standard. AIS is built using the .NET framework and SQL Server DBMS with prototyping methodology. After implementation, AIS was able to integrate the needs of data accreditation by providing data requirements and eliminates delaying data preparation by the related department since it was directly generated from the Polman Astra database. AIS is also able to manage the accreditation data table dynamically and transparently, eliminates paper printing costs into zero and prevent delays in the preparation of accreditation instruments so that the accreditation can be completed according to a predetermined time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusGarrett, N., Beard, N., Fiesler, C.57215664940;57108528100;36194796400;More than "if time allows": The role of ethics in AI education(2020) AIES 2020 - Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, pp. 272-278.

To meet this demand, universities clamor to add technical artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses into computing curriculum-but how are societal and ethical considerations part of this landscape? We explore two pathways for ethics content in AI education: (1) standalone AI ethics courses, and (2) integrating ethics into technical AI courses. For both pathways, we ask: What is being taught? As we train computer scientists who will build and deploy AI tools, how are we training them to consider the consequences of their work? In this exploratory work, we qualitatively analyzed 31 standalone AI ethics classes from 22 U.S. universities and 20 AI/ML technical courses from 12 U.S. universities to understand which ethics-related topics instructors include in courses. We identify and categorize topics in AI ethics education, share notable practices, and note omissions. Our analysis will help AI educators identify what topics should be taught and create scaffolding for developing future AI ethics education. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Curriculum;  Ethics educationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusChelberg, K., Bosman, L.57197757138;25958885500;American indian college student mentoring: A study to measure changes in self-efficacy(2020) Education Sciences, 10 (2), art. no. 38, .

This study sought to measure the perceived changes in participants’ self-efficacy and confidence in navigating the college environment as a result of their participation in a mentoring program and addressed the research question “How does mentoring contribute to changes in tribal college students reported self-efficacy?” Nineteen participants who had participated in a semester-long mentoring program were given a retrospective pre- then post-program survey to measure changes in participants’ perceived confidence in navigational and informational skills related to college success. Participants reported a significantly higher level of awareness in the post-program survey than they did in the pre-program survey across all of the mentoring program goals with the exception of one goal. In addition, there were no reported differences in AI and non-AI participants’ and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)/non-STEM responses on the five scaled variables for the mentoring survey. Providing support early on in a student’s educational career allows for the establishment of student connections with peers, support personnel, and resources that they can turn to for help in academics or setting goals. Additionally, early support provides encouragement and a sense of belief in themselves, which is critical to student success. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: Patients who showed PLAHF components in their eye-movement recording between January 2016 to January 2019 were included. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refraction, strabismus assessment, fundus photograph, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), full-field electroretinography (f-ERG), clinical ophthalmological examination, and gene tests were used to determine their clinical conditions, especially their retina conditions in all patients. Results: Among 136 patients there were 76 males and 60 females with mean age of 11.4.5 ± 4.5 years. Pure PLAHF waveforms were found in 38 patients (28%), the amplitude of the PLAHF was 2°±1.6° and frequency was 5–10 Hz. Superimposed PLAHF waveforms were found in 98 patients (72%). BCVA was worse than Log MAR1.0 in 94 patients (69%), between LogMar 0.5–1.0 (20/63-20/200) in 30 cases (22%); higher than LogMar 0.5 (20/63) in 12 cases (9%). Fifty-eight patients were diagnosed with exotropia and six patients with esotropia. Abnormal Fundus were found in 71 cases (52%), fovea hypoplasia was identified with OCT in 95 cases (70%) and retinal thinning in 92 cases (68%). Abnormal on-off VEP were found in 116 cases (85%). The f-ERG responses were reduced in all patients. In 46 patients, gene mutations were found to related to retinal disease, including 3 congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), 14 achromatopsia (ACHM), 5 Aland Island eye disease (AIED), 7 Alstrom syndrome (AS), 11 Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), 6 cone-rod dystrophy (CRD).

We built three classification models with training data of 76,936 posts from two large online forums and applied the models to classify messages into statistics-related and non-statistics-related posts in a private Facebook group. Three ML algorithms were compared in terms of classification effectiveness and congruency with human coding. Students with more messages endorsed by two or more ML algorithms as statistics-related had higher final course grades. Students who failed the course also had significantly fewer messages endorsed by all three ML algorithms than those who passed. Results suggest that ML can be used for identifying students in need of support within the personal learning environment and for quality control of the large-scale educational data. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence in Education;  Educational Data Mining;  facebook;  Learning Analytics;  Machine Learning;  Personal Learning EnvironmentDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMiller, D.D., Wood, E.A.8962196300;57646147900;AI, autonomous machines and human awareness: Towards shared machine-human contexts in medicine(2020) Human-Machine Shared Contexts, pp. 205-220.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124929687&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-12-820543-3.00010-9&partnerID=40&md5=edf101c499cdcda1b429fbea1bd66f3bDOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-820543-3.00010-9ABSTRACT: Medical curricula trend to integrate clinical skills training and to create efficiencies in preclinical medical sciences, but the rapid emergence big data-intensive health care has led to initiating collaborations among data scientists, computer engineers, and medical educators that might generate novel educational high-technology platforms and innovative AI practice applications.

It uses mechanisms based on artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks, to not only predict users’ behavior and needs but also to precipitate them. The idea of “media education 3.0" proceeds from the seven new-media practices identified as components of “media education 2.0": consciousness, communication, consumption and surveillance, convergence, creativity, copy-paste, and community. Media convergence and deep mediatization have transformed the existing media ecosystem into one in which mass media has ceased to play a hegemonic role, allowing digital media to become the center of people’s communicative lives. In the field of media and communication, but also of media education, technologies such as Big Data and algorithmic data processing are invisible presences. Digital data and hidden algorithms are intelligent mechanisms for managing user activity, behavior, attention, content, information, and knowledge when using media and new digital technologies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Algorithmic data processing;  Artificial intelligence;  Big data;  Deep mediatization;  Digital technologies;  Machine learning;  Media convergence;  Media education 3.0;  Neural networksDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusIto, T., Shin, M., Miyazaki, K., Tanaka, M.S.57189307517;57189304179;57189309776;57191908735;Research on the online pbl education system using ai(2020) International Research Symposium on PBL, pp. 13-22.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113176177&partnerID=40&md5=8bab89537f7ccd58d7aa68f0a3e59039ABSTRACT: The importance of problem-based learning and project-based learning (both abbreviated to PBL) which tackle complicated problems is perceived in engineering education and in addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Kanazawa Institute of Technology (KIT) applies PBL to its design and engineering program as Project Design (PD) Program to grow up independently minded, actively engaged engineers. Although many universities perform PBL in regular curriculum education, PBL contents depend on the teachers’ know-how or their individual guidance. To advance an educational reform, introduction of the online education system is promoted. In recent years, the classes based on lectures can be taken on-line. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) has spread all over the world. More than ten million learners use Cousera® or edX®. Other than MOOC, the flipped learning with e-learning or e-Syllabus is carried out widely using PC. Furthermore, the trial which uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Chatbot for education is studied. How can the combination of PBL and digitalization realize the online PBL education? Based on the rich instructional materials, students’ deliverables and questionnaire results of KIT PBL courses, the authors are investigating the online PBL education system which uses AI instead of teachers’ direct instruction. At first the system survey focused on digitalized design platform which students can use together to design online. There are several web-based design platforms available. These tools may be useful when the design objects are clear. However, we have noticed that more common communication tools are effective for our PD Program. There are many free communication and collaboration tools: students use SNS more than e-mail. We propose the on-line PBL education system using Slack and Chatbots. Since the system is still a development phase, we introduce the outline and feature. © The authors, 2020.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI (Artificial Intelligence);  Chatbot;  Online education;  PBL;  Text miningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusSemerikov, S.O., Shyshkina, M.P., Striuk, A.M., Striuk, M.I., Mintii, I.S., Kalinichenko, O.O., Kolgatina, L.S., Karpova, M.Y.56375008500;56289490700;57194524952;57216845494;57204971103;57222574729;56529712600;57224618454;8thworkshop on cloud technologies in education: Report(2020) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2879, pp. 1-69.

Within the production environments of the future, engineers and skilled workers will be reliant on information gathered from AI-based assistance systems while developing data-based solutions for complex issues of work. In this respect, integration of recent advances in AI and natural language processing could be of particular importance for engineering education. In respect to the design of engineering curricula, questions arise on how the existing body of knowledge can be linked to the topic of AI and beyond that integrate aspects of e.g. data literacy and motivation. The paper at hand focuses on providing reasons for integrating learning opportunities which deal with AI in engineering education. Therefore, the results of a questionnaire, carried out in the course of a research-oriented seminar, asking prospective technology teachers about their attitudes towards the use of AI in education will be discussed. Furthermore, guidance concerning the design and the integration of peer-to-peer AI workshops, in an interdisciplinary makerspace focusing on engineering education, will be presented. In the course of these learning activities, both future engineers and prospective technology teachers were confronted with reflective tasks in the context of the use of AI-based technology. The synthesis of the observations made, lead to a modular concept proposal to be discussed in this paper. Ultimately, the findings presented here, are perceptions from multiple projects, which will be merged within the framework of a more comprehensive project in the future. © 2020 SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings.

The anticipated surge in AI ethics education will force the field to reckon with delineating and then evaluating learner outcomes to determine what is working and improve what is not. We argue for a more descriptive than normative focus of this ethics education, and propose the development of assessments that can measure descriptive ethical thinking about AI. Such an assessment tool for measuring ethical reasoning capacity in CS contexts must be designed to produce reliable scores for which there is established validity evidence concerning their interpretation and use. © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusNeller, T.W., Keeley, S., Guerzhoy, M., Hoenig, W., Li, J., Koenig, S., Soni, A., Thomason, K., Zhang, L., Sebastian, B., Resnick, C., Oliver, A., Bhupatiraju, S., Agrawal, K.K., Allingham, J., Yoon, S., Chen, J., Larsen, T., Neumann, M., Norouzi, N., Hausen, R., Evett, M.6506914137;57193536339;24830485200;57223935903;57194178416;7103375132;56146863400;55868733800;57208268576;57225432633;57202456849;57208445392;55389646000;57210638157;57219749398;24544901700;57218926013;57223928667;57218924326;57210786343;56566598700;6602366347;Model ai assignments 2020(2020) AAAI 2020 - 34th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 13509-13511.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106530092&partnerID=40&md5=f4a08f71432772b366b95801e774d8ddABSTRACT: The Model AI Assignments session seeks to gather and disseminate the best assignment designs of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education community.

The need to rethink AI curriculum is pressing in a design education context because AI powers many emerging practical techniques such as drama management, procedural content generation, player modeling, and machine playtesting. In this paper, we describe a 5-year experimental effort to teach a Game AI course structured around a broad and expanding set of roles AI can play in game design (e.g., Adversary and Actor, as well as Design Assistant and Storyteller). This course sets up computer science and computer game design students to transform practices in the game industry as well as create new forms of media that were previously unreachable. Our students gained mastery over the relevant techniques and further demonstrated (via novel prototype systems) many new roles for AI along the way. © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.DOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusWong, K.-C.57222721818;Computational thinking and artificial intelligence education: A balanced approach using both classical ai and modern ai(2020) Proceedings of International Conference on Computational Thinking Education, pp. 110-111.

Background AI based teaching and learning solutions are amongst the most important educational innovations. The intervention of AI in instructional methods can result in personalized teaching and learning experiences. AI enabled teaching and learning systems can give teachers a better understanding regarding their students’ learning abilities, learning styles and progress. Methodology The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to find the relative importance of inhibiting and motivating factors. The primary data for making the pair-wise comparisons between the factors were obtained from a convenient sample of 32 teachers, teaching in various higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi, India. Contribution Though, the acceptance of AI based solutions has been studied in other con-texts such as retail, banking, ecommerce, and so on; nonetheless, the acceptance of AI in the education sector has not grabbed much attention of researchers. Hence the study has made worthwhile contributions to the literature as it has specifically focused on the adoption of AI based teaching methods by teachers in higher education Findings The findings suggest that institutional barriers are the major inhibitors and recognition is the main motivator that affect teachers’ behaviour towards adopting AI based teaching solutions. Overall, the findings of the study highlight the importance of institutional support in terms of resources, time, and recognition that may be provided to the teachers so that they can willingly integrate AI based methodologies into their teaching. Recommendations for Practitioners The study provides several implications for HEIs and developers of AI based educational solutions. The HEIs should provide adequate support to their teachers in terms of financial support, infrastructure and technical support. The developers should focus on developing such solutions that are compatible with the teachers’ existing work style. Recommendations for Researchers Future studies can employ statistical techniques such as multiple regression analysis or structural equation modelling to examine the impact of these factors on the actual use behaviour of teachers regarding AI based teaching methods. More diversified samples that are statistically significant in size, can be considered to examine the teachers’ behaviour regarding AI based instructional methods. Impact on Society AI technology can play a pivotal role in reshaping and remodeling higher education. AI is the technology of todays’ times that has the capability of transforming the instructional methods. The educators need to understand that nowadays, teaching and learning are heading towards creative styles that embrace the use of innovative technologies such as AI. Future Research The adoption of AI in the field of education is at a very nascent stage in India, constant changes are likely to happen in the factors influencing the adoption of AI enabled teaching solutions. Future studies may come up with a more holistic model of factors to address this research problem. © 2020 (CC BY-NC 4.0) This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

In education 4.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a key role in identifying new factors in students' performance and implementing personalized learning, answering routine student questions, using learning analytics, and predictive modeling. It is a new challenge to redefine education 4.0 to recognize the creative and innovative intelligent students, and it is difficult to determine students' outcomes. Hence, in this paper, Hybridized Deep Neural Network (HDNN) to predict student performance in Education 4.0. The proposed HDNN method is utilized to determine the dynamics that likely influence the student's performance. The deep neural network monitors predict, and evaluate students' performance in an education 4.0 environment. The findings show that the proposed HDNN method achieved better prediction accuracy when compared to other popular methods. © IBERAMIA and the authors.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Education 4.0;  Students Performance AnalysisDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusLi, S., Yan, M., Zhang, X., Li, Z.57219033760;56963231400;57190809613;57203558030;Analysis on the Application of AI Technology in Online Education Under the Public Epidemic Crisis(2020) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12555 LNCS, pp. 296-305.

Content analysis was conducted on AI R&D guidelines issued by more economically developed countries because they may guide the trend of AI-based applications in education. Specifically, this study consisted of three phases: 1) information retrieval, (2) key term extraction, and (3) data visualization. First, Fisher’s exact test was employed to ensure that different AI R&D guidelines (e.g., the latest ones in the US, EU, Japan, Mainland, and Taiwan) were comparable. Second, the Key Word Extraction System was developed to retrieve essential information in the guidelines. Third, data visualization techniques were performed on key terms across multiple guidelines. A word cloud revealed the similarity among guidelines (e.g., key terms that these guidelines share in common) while a color-coding scheme showed the differences (e.g., occurrence of a key term across guidelines and its frequency within a guideline). Importantly, three key terms, namely, AI, human, and development, are identified as essential commonality across guidelines. As for key terms that only extracted from particular guidelines, interestingly, results with the color-coding scheme suggested that these key terms were weighted differently depends on the developmental emphasis of a nation. Collectively, we discussed how these findings concerning ethics guidelines may shed light on AI research and development to educational technology. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Data visualization technique;  Education;  Ethics guidelines;  Text miningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusZhou, W.57220008641;Education for Bilingual Children in the Age of Artificial Intelligence(2020) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12487 LNCS, pp. 436-442.

The education modes for them have also seen great changes in the age of Artificial Intelligence. AI technologies, emerging as one of the most significant impetus for the change of the world in the 21st century, have greatly altered the previous situation of education in all regions of the world. In this paper, the author firstly presents the current situations of both AI technologies and bilingual children. Then the ways AI can be integrated into the education for bilingual children have been discussed from the perspectives of bilingual children themselves, their families and schools. In spite of the benefits AI has brought to education, challenges are also noticeable at the same time. Therefore, external factors in technological and educational aspects and internal factors in psychological, physical and emotional areas should be carefully taken into consideration in the education for bilingual children. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial Intelligence;  Bilingual children;  EducationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusHibbi, F.-Z., Abdoun, O., Haimoudi, E.K.57220154280;55382584900;56979381000;Integrating an intelligent tutoring system into an adaptive e-learning process(2020) Applied and Numerical Harmonic Analysis, pp. 141-150.

This helps learners to develop their skills, while making the learning process independent of time and place. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in education were tested to increase learning experience. AI researchers look for domain applications, beginning to apply their ideas by tracking students on a course. Intelligent systems apply artificial intelligence techniques to meet the needs of their users; these methods allow the performance of an e-learning system to be increased by analyzing and adapting the profile of learning behavior and learning styles. Therefore, the objective of this chapter is to present the requirements for integrating AI into e-learning systems. The results showed significant advantages when including AI techniques, specifically intelligent tutoring system, in the learning process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  E-learning system;  Intelligent tutoring system;  Learning processDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusZhang, S., Liu, M., Zhang, J.57224866183;57226036869;57224882207;An Academic Achievement Prediction Model Enhanced by Stacking Network(2020) Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1181, pp. 235-245.

So far, there are already many well-built gradient boosting machines for small data sets prediction, such as lightGBM, XGBoost, etc. Based on this, we presented and experimented a new method in a regression prediction. Our Stacking Network combines the traditional ensemble models with the idea of deep neural network. Compared with the original Stacking method, Stacking Network can infinitely increase the number of layers, making the effect of Stacking Network much higher than that of traditional Stacking. Simultaneously, compared with deep neural network, this Stacking Network inherits the advantages of the Boosting machines. We have applied this approach to achieve higher accuracy and better speed than the conventional Deep neural network. And also, we achieved a highest rank on the Middle School Grade Dataset provided by Shanghai Telecom Corporation. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Data mining;  Machine learning;  Stacking networkDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusGao, Z., Wanyama, T., Singh, I.57202910759;8948580700;55796453400;Project and practice centered learning: A systematic methodology and strategy to cultivate future full stack artificial intelligence engineers(2020) International Journal of Engineering Education, 36 (6), pp. 1760-1772.

Based on more interactive and practical training in hands-on activities, mini-projects, mid-term project, workshop, and capstone-like course final project, students learn to: (a) how to integrate AI sub topics to address issues raised from real-life, (b) how to create and analysis their own training and testing datasets, and (c) how to compare performance of different AI models, (d) inspire students’ innovation ability, (e) cultivate their comprehensive ability to design and implement a sophisticated system individually, etc. Based on feedbacks from students and peers, the proposed PPCL based AI teaching and learning was effective. This pedagogy can also be applied to AI related courses and other technical engineering courses. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  Project and practice centered learning;  Teaching strategy;  Voice recognitionDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusGreen, N.L., Crotts, L.J.7201728686;57219773229;Argument schemes for AI ethics education(2020) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2669, pp. 41-50.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095421126&partnerID=40&md5=a60d5dfd8b4e6f521ae09236f6bc66d6ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a novel approach to AI Ethics education using new argument schemes summarizing key ethical considerations for specialized domains such as military and healthcare AI applications.

However, it takes a long time to analyse videos, and teachers are easy to fall into the state of information overload. With the development of "AI + education,"automatic recognition of teacher behavior to support teaching reflection has become an important research topic. In this paper, taking online open classroom teaching video as the data source, we collected and constructed a teacher behavior dataset. Using this dataset, we explored the behavior recognition methods based on RGB video and skeleton information, and the information fusion between them is carried out to improve the recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that the fusion of RGB information and skeleton information can improve the recognition accuracy, and the early-fusion effect is better than the late-fusion effect. This study helps to solve the problems of time-consumption and information overload in teaching reflection and then helps teachers to optimize the teaching strategies and improve the teaching efficiency. © 2020 Dongli Wu et al.DOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusSun, H.57219566143;The Research of Music AI in the Context of Information Security(2020) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12465 LNAI, pp. 593-600.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093915700&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-60796-8_51&partnerID=40&md5=f478a05912d4ed3db7b3af674ad4bf24DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-60796-8_51ABSTRACT: In this article through the analysis and summary of the specialty characteristics of undergraduate and postgraduate students, we explore in detail the advantages and features of AI in music composition, performance and education and conclude that AI cannot replace humans, but it performs much better than humans in many aspects, and that in the future, the new music ecology of music AI + database + music education + social interaction will become an inevitable trend with the development of AI. The article also studies the “information security” factors in the application of music AI, and emphasizes that the “information security” includes not only the awareness and understanding of information system risks, but also the technical and operational specifications for preventing such risks.

The proposed approach includes methodologies and tools aimed at promoting critical thinking in students. It has been structured in four main operational phases to facilitate implementation and replication, and it is currently tested with 77 high-school students (14−16 years old). Preliminary insights from this pilot study are also presented in this paper. We argue that the integrated approach can be comprised in a more general framework designed to boost competences of reasoning of students, which are crucial in promoting fake news detection and, consequently, in preventing the spreading of on line false information.

Digital games are accessible and affordable to anyone and provide opportunities for at-scale teaching and learning. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in digital games to support computational thinking and programming in pre-college (K–12) schools. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are a rapidly developing field, attracting an increasing number of learners in the past few years. Although the confluence of digital games and AI/ML is an important and challenging field for teaching and learning researchers, a literature review has not yet been conducted in this area. The purpose of this work is to present a review of recent research into games to support AI and ML education. After a thorough search, relevant papers and games were selected and included in our qualitative content analysis. Based on this review, we present an overview of the relevant research papers and games, as well as showcased how different games provide a unique opportunity to teach a number of different concepts and topics in AI and ML. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  Educational games;  Literature review;  Machine learning educationDOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusSaltman, K.J.26531789100;Artificial intelligence and the technological turn of public education privatization: In defence of democratic education(2020) London Review of Education, 18 (2), pp. 196-208.

The introduction situates the advent of digital technologies in the context of the structural economic and ideological shifts of the past 40 years. Such changes include neo-liberal restructuring, the repressive school and social turn, changes in the use of positivist ideology in schooling, the role of new technologies in social and cultural reproduction and changing imperatives for capital accumulation. The article illustrates different uses of AI as part of the technological turn of public education privatization. Examples include: (1) adaptive learning technology, and transformations to teacher work and conceptions of knowledge and learning; (2) biometric pedagogy and the cultural politics of locating learning in the body; and (3) the convergence of impact investing and digital surveillance technologies. The article considers how changes in the ownership and control over different aspects of public education relate to the cultural politics of knowledge and learning. It also examines how, under the guise of disinterested objectivity and neutrality, particular class and cultural ideologies and interests are promoted through new technologies, with significant pedagogical, cultural, economic and political implications. The article concludes by arguing that AI education is a site of cultural and political contestation and must be comprehended as a form of representational politics. By showing a critical pedagogical AI project, the article suggests that the anti-democratic tendencies of most AI education is hardly inevitable or determined, but rather represents a replication of long-standing ideologies. © 2020 Saltman.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptive learning;  Artificial intelligence;  Critical pedagogy;  Democratic education;  Social impact bondsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusWoo, H., Kim, J., Kim, J., Lee, W.57216339304;55851714000;36704934600;56164989400;Exploring the AI topic composition of K-12 using NMF-based topic modeling(2020) International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 10 (4), pp. 1471-1476.

The student performance data taken over a six-year period in multiple courses ranging from the mid- to the advanced level and a diverse course offering mode (i.e., on-campus, ONC, and online, ONL) are modelled by ELM and further benchmarked against competing models: random forest (RF) and Volterra. With the assessments and examination marks as key predictors of WS (leading to a grade in the mid-level course), ELM (with respect to RF and Volterra) outperformed its counterpart models both for the ONC and the ONL offer. This generated relative prediction error in the testing phase, of only 0.74%, compared to about 3.12% and 1.06%, respectively, while for the ONL offer, the prediction errors were only 0.51% compared to about 3.05% and 0.70%. In modelling the student performance in advanced engineering mathematics course, ELM registered slightly larger errors: 0.77% (vs. 22.23% and 1.87%) for ONC and 0.54% (vs. 4.08% and 1.31%) for the ONL offer. This study advocates a pioneer implementation of a robust AI methodology to uncover relationships among student learning variables, developing teaching and learning intervention and course health checks to address issues related to graduate outcomes, and student learning attributes in the higher education sector. © 2013 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI in higher education;  Education decision-making;  engineering mathematics;  extreme learning machine;  student performance modellingDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, Gold, GreenSOURCE: ScopusHolstein, K., Aleven, V., Rummel, N.57190763027;6602528401;57204347222;A conceptual framework for human–AI hybrid adaptivity in education(2020) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12163 LNAI, pp. 240-254.

In practice, beyond being a property of AIEd systems alone, adaptivity is often jointly enacted by AI systems and human facilitators (e.g., teachers or peers). Despite much recent research activity, theoretical and conceptual guidance for the design of such human–AI systems remains limited. In this paper we explore how adaptivity may be shared across AIEd systems and the various human stakeholders who work with them. Based on a comparison of prior frameworks, which tend to examine adaptivity in AIEd systems or human coaches separately, we first synthesize a set of dimensions general enough to capture human–AI hybrid adaptivity. Using these dimensions, we then present a conceptual framework to map distinct ways in which humans and AIEd systems can augment each other’s abilities. Through examples, we illustrate how this framework can be used to characterize prior work and envision new possibilities for human–AI hybrid approaches in education. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Adaptivity;  Collaboration;  Framework;  Human–AI hybrid;  OrchestrationDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusChen, J.Q.56685114600;Enhancing strategic-level wargaming with artificial intelligence(2020) National Cyber Emergencies: The Return to Civil Defence, pp. 211-225.

It affects every walk of life, including military operations. Nowadays, it is unthinkable to conduct a military operation without utilising tools and resources in the cyber domain. Cyberspace possesses some unique characteristics. Without a good understanding of these unique characteristics, it is hard to imagine how a senior or a rising senior military officer can effectively incorporate cyber capabilities in strategies and campaign plans. For this reason, a cyber component should be included in the joint professional military education (JPME). Artificial intelligence (AI), which is one of the major enablers of capabilities in cyberspace, supports both automation and autonomy. Beyond doubt, it can lead to competitive advantage. Its unmatchable capabilities not only can be utilised in military operations but also can be employed in enhancing strategic-level wargaming exercises in the JPME programs. This chapter examines the characteristics of cyberspace and the characteristics of cyber storms, discusses the challenges in this space as well as the challenges in strategic-level wargaming used in the JPME programs, and proposes an AI-based model in dealing with all these challenges. Use cases are described to show the capabilities of this model. Its benefits and limitations are discussed. Future study is suggested to further improve this model, which can be a game-changer in supporting strategic thinking as well as military operations. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Greg Austin; individual chapters, the contributors.DOCUMENT TYPE: Book ChapterPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusRekh, S., Chandy, A.15064614200;55662149900;Implementation of academia 4.0 for engineering college education(2020) Procedia Computer Science, 172, pp. 673-678.

Therefore, under the foreign language teaching system, “AI + Education” has become a new trend of current research and can improve the teaching efficiency of college foreign language education. Therefore, AI has gradually become the focus of foreign language education. At present, AI mainly plays four roles in the world: learning partner, student, AI teacher and classroom teacher. However, through the development of “AI + Education”, Japanese education is not only applied in pre class, classroom, after class, extracurricular, examination and other teaching environments, but also brings profound changes to Japanese teaching. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the current application of AI in foreign language teaching and its influence on College Japanese teaching, as well as the role-playing and future challenges. It can provide reference ideas and experience for College Japanese education in the development of AI teachers and the construction of dual teacher classroom. Its research methods are data search and induction, and in terms of the impact on Japanese teaching, questionnaire survey is used to analyze the relevance of its data. The results of the analysis are helpful to understand the application and current situation of students’ AI + education. Furthermore, effective improvement strategies will be provided, which will contribute to the development of foreign language teaching and Japanese education in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Foreign language teaching;  Intelligent teaching system;  Japanese teaching in colleges and universities;  Network teachingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusMouta, A., Sánchez, E.T., Llorente, A.M.P.57211945974;56423687200;57216798702;Sense of Agency in Times of Automation: A Teachers’ Professional Development Proposal on the Ethical Challenges of AI Applied to Education(2020) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12164 LNAI, pp. 405-408.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088594916&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-52240-7_73&partnerID=40&md5=3cc98ccd369b695fd4f144e6c79c908bDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-52240-7_73ABSTRACT: The possibilities given by artificial intelligence are becoming enactments of what once were just distant fictional displays.

Such cases have often been called “wheel-spinning,” “unproductive persistence,” or “unproductive struggle.” We argue that most existing efforts rely on operationalizations and prediction targets that are misaligned to the approaches of real-world instructional systems. We illustrate facets of misalignment using Carnegie Learning’s MATHia as a case study, raising important questions being addressed by on-going efforts and for future work. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Intelligent tutoring systems;  Mastery learning;  Unproductive struggle;  Wheel-spinningDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusChoi, Y., Lee, Y., Shin, D., Cho, J., Park, S., Lee, S., Baek, J., Bae, C., Kim, B., Heo, J.57218279963;57218279287;57218283487;57218280332;57218284538;57218280987;57218285675;57218277466;57218284065;57218283187;EdNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset in Education(2020) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12164 LNAI, pp. 69-73.

Unfortunately, collecting student interaction data is challenging and costly. As a result, there is no public large-scale benchmark dataset reflecting the wide variety of student behaviors observed in modern IESs. Although several datasets, such as ASSISTments, Junyi Academy, Synthetic and STATICS are publicly available and widely used, they are not large enough to leverage the full potential of state-of-the-art data-driven models. Furthermore, the recorded behavior is limited to question-solving activities. To this end, we introduce EdNet, a large-scale hierarchical dataset of diverse student activities collected by Santa, a multi-platform self-study solution equipped with an artificial intelligence tutoring system. EdNet contains 131,417,236 interactions from 784,309 students collected over more than 2 years, making it the largest public IES dataset released to date. Unlike existing datasets, EdNet records a wide variety of student actions ranging from question-solving to lecture consumption to item purchasing. Also, EdNet has a hierarchical structure which divides the student actions into 4 different levels of abstractions. The features of EdNet are domain-agnostic, allowing EdNet to be easily extended to different domains. The dataset is publicly released for research purposes. We plan to host challenges in multiple AIEd tasks with EdNet to provide a common ground for the fair comparison between different state-of-the-art models and to encourage the development of practical and effective methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AIEd;  Artificial intelligence;  Dataset;  Education;  Knowledge tracingDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusSjödén, B.24833231200;When Lying, Hiding and Deceiving Promotes Learning - A Case for Augmented Intelligence with Augmented Ethics(2020) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12164 LNAI, pp. 291-295.

As indicated by a recent call by the AIED Society to focus on the FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) of AI in education, fundamental issues in this area remain to be explicated, and teachers’ perspectives need to be accounted for. The paper offers examples of how AI may serve to promote learning but at the cost of presenting limited or untruthful information to the student. For example, false information about a student’s current progress may motivate students to finish a task they would otherwise give up; hiding information from the student that is disclosed to the teacher may decrease students’ cognitive load while supporting the teacher’s strategic choices, and deceiving the student as to the actual nature of the task or interaction, such as when using virtual agents, can increase students’ efforts towards learning. Potential conflicts between such scenarios and basic values of FATE are discussed, and the basis for developing an “augmented ethics” system to support teachers’ decision-making is presented. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Augmented ethics;  Augmented intelligence;  Ethics;  FATE;  Teacher perspectivesDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, BronzeSOURCE: ScopusVolkova, E.V.13608354200;Assessing and Development of Chemical Intelligence Through e-Learning Tools(2020) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1228 AISC, pp. 795-805.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088519450&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-52249-0_54&partnerID=40&md5=461d1bf25405cabd851b31bd5f8e5999DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-52249-0_54ABSTRACT: Modern society has entered a new era, due to the rapid development of digital technologies. The lag in the use of digital technologies poses a serious danger, causing a sharp drop in the quality of education and the dissatisfaction of public needs. AI-technology in education are designed to enhance learning capabilities of student. However, it was revealed an extremely controversial attitude towards AI-technologies in education: from enthusiastic to negative. The key reason for the lack of effectiveness of AI-technologies in chemistry teaching is to reduce technologies to a set of procedures for content delivery, control, and assessment. Such kind of technologies does not improve the students’ mental abilities and does not develop of their thinking. The question arises: what algorithms should be embedded in artificial intelligence technologies so that they contribute to the mental development of the user? The article discusses the possibilities of using the hidden mechanisms of consciousness as the basis for the elaboration of human developmental algorithms. The rules for the elaboration of algorithms and the sequence of presentation of educational content are formulated. Criteria for stopping the cyclic algorithm and transition from one cyclic algorithm to another are proposed. The results of verification of rules and criteria are analyzed using the example of the GreatChemist Expert System for evaluating and developing chemical intelligence. The results of the test-retest reliability of technology for the development of chemical intelligence using the GreatChemist Expert System are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Chemical intelligence;  e-Learning tools;  GreatChemist Expert SystemDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusBerendt, B., Littlejohn, A., Blakemore, M.6602128202;7005935975;57217864599;AI in education: learner choice and fundamental rights(2020) Learning, Media and Technology, pp. 312-324.

The article is based on an EU scoping study [Berendt, B., A. Littlejohn, P. Kern, P. Mitros, X. Shacklock, and M. Blakemore. 2017. Big Data for Monitoring Educational Systems. Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union. https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/94cb5fc8-473e-11e7-aea8-01aa75ed71a1/]. The study takes into account the potential for AI and ‘Big Data’ to provide more effective monitoring of the education system in real-time, but also considers the implications for fundamental human rights and freedoms of both teachers and learners. The analysis highlights a need to balance the benefits and risks as AI tools are developed, marketed and deployed. We conclude with a call to embed consideration of the benefits and risks of AI in education as technology tools into the development, marketing and deployment of these tools. There are questions around who–which body or organisation–should take responsibility for regulating AI in education, particularly since AI impacts not only data protection and privacy, but on fundamental rights in general. Given AI’s global impact, it should be regulated at a trans-national level, with a global organisation such as the UN taking on this role. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence;  Big Data;  data protection;  education;  fundamental rights;  predictive analyticsDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GreenSOURCE: ScopusOreshin, S.A., Filchenkov, A.A., Kozlova, D.K., Petrusha, P.G., Lisitsyna, L.S., Panfilov, A.N., Glukhov, I.A., Krasheninnikov, E.I., Buraya, K.I.57209322134;55507568200;57210564078;57210555199;56203524600;57217099706;57245400900;57217108019;57189904944;The Use of Students’ Digital Portraits in Creating Smart Higher Education: A Case Study of the AI Benefits in Analyzing Educational and Social Media Data(2020) Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 188, pp. 233-243.

But there are a few studies that discuss the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in providing comprehensive and predictive analysis not limited to educational outcomes but focused on students’ individual portraits and aimed at improving the quality of education and provision of an integrated educational environment. This paper investigates role, application, and challenges of applying AI to targets and features of smart education concept: proactive, predictive analysis based on instruments aimed at building up a system that not only records students’ performance but also predicts and influences it. This study offers the concept of the comprehensive system of the university targeting to provide predictive analysis of students’ performance based on quantitative and qualitative information from multiple sources concerning students’ education, research performance, and social network information joined into unified, comprehensive dataset of each student (digital portraits) that allows to design individual tracks and use advising system to correct this track according to students’ needs and personal goals. As a result, we can predict students’ dropout with almost 90% accuracy. The main research problem of the study is to observe the implementation of AI instruments in higher education according to the needs and goals of universities and personal goals of each student and investigate the impact of this in blending different types of educational activity and creation of the integrated educational environment.

It redefines our understanding of how to represent and process knowledge, and how to maximize its role in our everyday lives. Beyond its commercial success, Semantic Web is a fertile domain for AI education allowing us to revisit some of the core topics in an undergraduate AI course such as knowledge engineering, representation and reasoning. This paper describes our experience with introducing a hands-on project utilizing the latest Semantic Web technologies to teach Ontological Engineering and Description Logics to computer science majors at undergraduate level. Our motivation was not to replace established AI curriculum, but to illustrate the evolving understanding of AI from a stand-alone problem solver into a network of intelligent agents working in cooperation and serving as equal partners to humans in a variety of applications built on the top of the Semantic Web. Initial assessment of the pedagogical value of this project suggests that it enhances students' understanding of the core AI topics, boosts their engagement and interest in the course, but more importantly introduces them to the most prominent field of applied AI for the years to come.

AIEd has barely scratched the surface. It will redefine the role of the teacher and support creative and human acts that provide ingenuity and empathy in support of learning. The gold is in the data. As AI interprets data, examines the role of the teacher or expert, supports classroom evolution and provides one on one tutoring, AIEd will be inextricably linked to the future of AI. AI comes with opportunities and many challenges. The adoption rate of new AI technologies seems to be on a path unprecedented in history. AI will need to provide insight in to learning and measure innate characteristics like curiosity and creativity. New pedagogies, research into existing learning sciences and learning contexts are needed. © 2020 by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.

Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning. © 2013 IEEE.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence;  Education;  leanerDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: FinalOPEN ACCESS: All Open Access, GoldSOURCE: ScopusChatterjee, S., Bhattacharjee, K.K.56857082100;56435836000;Adoption of artificial intelligence in higher education: a quantitative analysis using structural equation modelling(2020) Education and Information Technologies, .

Use of AI in will bring in effective change of governance in the entire internal architecture of Indian Institutes of higher education. The prospect of use of AI includes investigation of educational implications as to how teachers would enrich them, how students would learn, and how accurate and prompt decisions can be taken in the institutes of higher education. This is important since the workload has been multiplied due to massification of higher education. Such being the scenario, help of AI is highly essential. The question of adoption of AI in higher education is an important issue in this perspective. The purpose of this study is to explore how the stakeholders would be able to adopt it. For this, we have taken help of many adoption theories and models including ‘Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology’ (UTAUT) model. We have developed hypotheses and a conceptual model and got it validated through survey with the help of feedbacks from useable 329 respondents. It has been found that the model can help the authorities to facilitate adoption of AI in higher education. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI;  Attitude;  Behavioural intention;  Education;  IndiaDOCUMENT TYPE: ArticlePUBLICATION STAGE: Article in PressSOURCE: ScopusGoel, R., Gupta, P.57204963661;55466518700;Robotics and Industry 4.0(2020) Advances in Science, Technology and Innovation, pp. 157-169.

The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has provided new methodologies to utilize large amounts of data for educational purposes. A significant criticism of the use of artificial intelligence in education has been a lack of transparency in the algorithms’ decision-making processes. This study aims to 1) introduce a new framework using explainable artificial intelligence for simulation-based training in surgery, and 2) validate the framework by creating the Virtual Operative Assistant, an automated educational feedback platform. Twenty-eight skilled participants (14 staff neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 PGY 4–6 residents) and 22 novice participants (10 PGY 1–3 residents, 12 medical students) took part in this study. Participants performed a virtual reality subpial brain tumor resection task on the NeuroVR simulator using a simulated ultrasonic aspirator and bipolar. Metrics of performance were developed, and leave-one-out cross validation was employed to train and validate a support vector machine in Matlab. The classifier was combined with a unique educational system to build the Virtual Operative Assistant which provides users with automated feedback on their metric performance with regards to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The Virtual Operative Assistant successfully classified skilled and novice participants using 4 metrics with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 92, 82 and 100%, respectively. A 2-step feedback system was developed to provide participants with an immediate visual representation of their standing related to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The educational system outlined establishes a basis for the potential role of integrating artificial intelligence and virtual reality simulation into surgical educational teaching. The potential of linking expertise classification, objective feedback based on proficiency benchmarks, and instructor input creates a novel educational tool by integrating these three components into a formative educational paradigm. © 2020 Mirchi et al.

Interactive machines are already tutoring students in classrooms. It is anticipated that in the near future, social robots will become integral part of schools to enhance student learning experiences. This paper reports the preliminary investigation of participating students’ experience through a new robotics competition focusing on the use of a social robot as a standard platform robot for primary and secondary school students. This report is part of a larger study of the World Robot Summit Junior Category’sSchool Robot Challenge. The School Robot Challenge at the Junior Category of the World Robot Summit (WRS), inspired by the WRS’s aim to envision a society where humans and robots coexist and collaborate together, prepares students to participate in robotics and A.I. research and development in the future by offering a new robotics competition for students to design Co-Bot experience (human-robot co-existence) at school, hosted by the Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Educational robotics;  Human robot interaction;  Robotics competition;  Social robotDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusPan, M., Wu, B., Zhang, Y.57204802897;57212171625;57214252496;Curriculum Design of AI Experimental Course Based on CDIO Model(2020) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1075, pp. 525-531.https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076844980&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-32591-6_56&partnerID=40&md5=4cb5322e220a4a1c4f44f72ffce4590aDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-32591-6_56ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence education has received great attention, and it is one of the current research hotspots. In many artificial intelligence algorithms, search algorithm is a basis in the field of artificial intelligent. In particular, it is widely used in the field of knowledge discovery. In this paper, we use the CDIO approach to design an AI Experimental course on search algorithms and implement this course. In the implementation process, we teach students how to apply search strategies in robot tasks through the CDIO theory framework. Feedback from students participating in the experimental course shows that this method has a good application promising. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: AI education;  CDIO model;  Curriculum design;  Search algorithmDOCUMENT TYPE: Conference PaperPUBLICATION STAGE: FinalSOURCE: ScopusRandhawa, G.K., Jackson, M.55793695500;56942811800;The role of artificial intelligence in learning and professional development for healthcare professionals(2020) Healthcare Management Forum, 33 (1), pp. 19-24.
